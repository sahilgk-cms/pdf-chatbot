Target geographies  
In line with our new programme strategy, we have narrowed the operational focus of our holistic prevention model in West Beng al 
to five districts - Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling, Alipurduar, Murshidabad and North 24 Parganas. Each of the districts belong to diffe rent 
divisions in the state1 
 
We selected the five districts from among the 6 districts where we have operated to date, after taking into consideration cri tical 
factors like vulnerability of communities and children, strengths of previous investments, government collaborations, and potential 
repercussions on local communities.  
 
We will phase out over a period of 6-9 months from the rest of the areas to minimise disruption of existing prevention and survivor 
reintegration efforts.

Context and problem statement 
West Bengal is a source, transit, and destination state for human trafficking. The state witnessed the highest number of chil dren trafficked within India in the year 2016 2. Additionally, 
the National Family Health Survey Report-V shows that nearly 48% of rural girls in West Bengal are married off before reaching adulthood. West Bengal also ranks high among the child 
labour-prone states of India. As per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) 2021, the state is in the 4 th position for various forms of crimes against children. Hence, working for child 
protection in this state is essential. 
 
 
2 https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/west-bengal-records-highest-number-of-human-trafficking-cases-in-2016-1782177  
West Bengal also faces a complex set of poverty and developmental challenges that demand careful attention and strategic plan ning. We specifically chose to focus on the five districts 
mentioned earlier due to their high rates of child rights violations as per the NCRB, high rate of school dropouts (UDISE data) and government recommendations during our engagement 
with government stakeholders. 
 
The following are the common issues prevalent across the five districts selected under this programme: 
 
• High vulnerability: West Bengal is the fourth most populous state in India with a population of 97.7 million, a fifth of which are poor. A substantial portion of its populace comprises 
of children. Several of these children are often victims of abuse, exploitation, neglect and violence within their own families, schools, and communities. Vulnerability to various forms of 
deprivation such as poverty, malnutrition, safe shelter, lack of access to education, etc. affect many children in these four districts. 
 
• Child rights violations: Various forms of child rights violations persist, such as child marriage, child trafficking, child sexual abuse and child labour across these four districts. It is 
imperative to focus on addressing these issues within these districts to safeguard children from harm, prevent their exploitation, and facilitate their growth, wellbeing, and participation 
in India’s development story. 
 
• Development challenges: The districts  of Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Murshidabad , and North  24 Parganas also grapple  with a multitude  of socio-economic challenges, 
characterised by restricted availability of basic services such as healthcare, early childhood care & development, and employment opportunities for vulnerable households.  
 
• Education and awareness: Numerous children in West Bengal lack access to high -quality and equitable education. This factor coupled with poor school facilities results in high child 
dropout rates, especially among the girls from marginalised communities. According to government data, West Bengal was among the dozen -odd states that had secondary school 
dropout rates higher than the national average of 14.6% in 2022.  
 
Hence, undertaking a comprehensive education, child protection and social protection initiative across these 5 districts is i mperative given the heightened vulnerability of children. 
Collaborating closely with both government authorities and local communities will enable us to attain success in safeguarding children and fostering their comprehensive development. 
This approach aims  to shield them from economic and social hardships while facilitating their access to essential services such as healthcare with focus on mental health services, 
education, nutrition, and eventually ensuring their well-being. 
 
Over the last year, the programme spanned 6 districts and achieved the following:  
 
• 2,363 members of 94 collectives were made active. 
• 336 children core group members (66% of target) emerged as active leaders on issues like gender equality, school enrolment etc. 
• In the newly added districts, 90 children’s collectives have been formed till date. 2300 children between the age of 10-18 years are members of these collectives. 
• 568 community-based institutions were made active of which 136 were VCPCs, 282 were SHGs, 42 were mothers’ groups, 71 were parents' groups and 37 were local clubs. 
• In four districts, 136 VLCPCs have been formed and are monitored through regular updates and linkages to the various child protection agencies. 
• Partners also initiated community-based processes to identify and resolve child protection cases. So far, 229 cases (23.5% of those identified) have been resolved. 
• To reduce vulnerabilities of children, 131 dropout children have been re -enrolled in schools. Every month, 90% of the formed  VLCPCs have been meeting regularly to discuss child 
protection issues. Some of the VLCPCs have also started taking independent actions where they have stopped child marriages and re -enrolled dropout children into schools. 
 
Project executive summary 
In the upcoming year, our current strategy will primarily focus on prevention approaches; and derives from the critical learnings and achievements of the Prevention of Trafficking Model 
and our subsequent efforts in West Bengal. Therefore, our holistic programme model addresses  not only child trafficking but also other critical issues affecting the wellbeing of the 
vulnerable children and their families. It aims to systematically identify, reach, and empower most vulnerable communities in West Bengal to protect their children from various violations  
of child rights. Given the concerning indicators regarding child protection, our initiative seeks to address the root causes of these violations and ensure that children are safe within their 
communities. 
 
During the gating period, the project will consolidate learnings so far to pilot a holistic model which will implement three critical interventions in the same community:  
• Build economic resilience of vulnerable families through access to social security and livelihoods: By prioritising vulnerable families’ access to social security schemes covering health, 
livelihoods, education, we can address their basic needs. This will be done with support from District Child Protection Units (DCPUs) and Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs).  We will 
also link vulnera ble families at alternative livelihood options to increase household incomes.  Once the bare minimum is solved for, providing access to alternative livelihoods will 
help families build positive aspirations, complement their incomes, and minimise the risk of them turning to detrimental practices like child labour, child marriage, and child trafficking  
• Using schools as safety nets and safe spaces: Safe and thriving learning environments indirectly mitigate risks of children falling into child labour, child marriage, and unsafe migration. 
The project will undertake interventions to identify out of school children and ensure re -enrolment. All vulnerable children under the age o f 14 will be supported to continue in 
school.  
• Strengthening community and governance institutions for structural, local, and timely response to child protection issues. Th is will include a systematic mapping and identification 
of all vulnerable children in the intervention districts, which will form t he basis of tracking programme impact, success, and learnings.   
 
Over the next year, we will identify additional capacity needs and partner with technical resource organisations to further enhance the capacities of our implementing organisations. 
Through this collaborative endeavour, we hope to achieve our long -term objectives in child protection and community development within the seven blocks across the five selected 
districts. We will work closely with children, communities, and government systems. This holistic strategy will emphasise on prevention and community-level interventions and support. 
It will involve engaging with children directly, empowering them with knowledge and skills to protect themselves and creating safe spaces for them to report any abuse or exploitation. 
At the community level, our interventions will also play a pivotal role in raising awareness, sensitising families, and foste ring a culture of child protection. 
 
We will also collaborate with government systems to ensure the best alignment of the policies and resources to effectively address the vulnerabilities of children and their families. 
Through increased awareness, we will ensure mandatory reporting of cases of child abuse/ exploitation and subsequently facilitate enforcement of laws. By working closely with the PRI 
and block administration, we will ensure access to the social care and protection services. 
 
We will also be working with survivors in the target locations to establish a robust survivors’ network and will empower the survivors, enhancing their resilience to prevent re-trafficking 
and other forms of abuse and exploitation. This network will offer peer support to fellow survivors across the five districts and help to bring about systemic change. This approach ensures 
sustainability and the creation of a supportive ecosystem  for individuals who have endured similar forms of exploitation and abuse, fostering a safer and more compassionate 
environment for them. 
 
The project is built on evidence from our past work and stakeholder engagement at the local level. On one hand, this ensures that our programme is informed by real time insights 
into the impact of our work, while on the other, we are able to closely collaborate with the government to integrate best practices and scale up initiatives implemented by our partners 
in pilot villages. Through effective stakeholder engagement, we seek to institutionalise successful interventions and amplify  their impact.

Scale-up plan  
 
Our scale-up plan aims to extend the impact of our child protection program by leveraging insights gained from Gating period initiative s and fostering collaboration with government agencies 
and community stakeholders. Building upon successful strategies identified during this phase, we will implement changes at the division level, ensuring that interventions are effectively scal ed 
across targeted districts and states. Through community ownership, government engagement, and capacity building efforts, we s eek to institutionalize best practices within the child 
protection system, driving sustained improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and practices at both the grassroots and instituti onal levels. By gathering evidence for scaling up and fostering 
partnerships with key stakeholders, we aim to create lasting change and promote the well-being of children and families across our target regions 
 
To elaborate, the scale up plan will entail: 
 
1. Review and Analysis of Gating Period Learnings 
 
• Gather comprehensive data from the pilot programs, including quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback from stakeholders.  
• Analyse the data to identify successful strategies that yielded significant impact, as well as challenges encountered during implementation. 
• Utilise insights gained to refine and adapt strategies for broader implementation at the district level.  
 
2. Community Ownership: 
 
• Foster strong community engagement through participatory approaches that involve local residents in the decision -making process 
• Implement community-led initiatives that empower individuals and groups to take ownership of child protection efforts within their communities.  
• Facilitate knowledge sharing and capacity building among community members to sustain positive changes beyond the duration of  the programme. 
 
3. District Level Implementation:  
 
• Develop a detailed implementation plan in collaboration with partners, aligning it with the overarching goals of the child protection program.  
• Establish clear communication channels and coordination mechanisms among all stakeholders involved in district -level implementation. 
• Provide ongoing support and guidance to district-level teams to ensure effective execution of the program objectives.  
 
4. Engagement with Government:  
 
• Develop a comprehensive engagement strategy for interacting with Govt. officials at various levels, emphasising the importanc e of their involvement in the program. 
• Organise regular meetings and workshops to facilitate dialogue and collaboration between program implementers and government stakeholders. 
• Provide technical assistance and policy recommendations to support Govt. efforts in strengthening child protection systems.  
 
5. Capacity Building of Government Institutions: 
 
• Conduct thorough needs assessments to identify specific areas where Govt. institutions require capacity building support.  
• Tailor training programs to address identified capacity gaps, ensuring that they are relevant, accessible and engaging for pa rticipants. 
• Work closely with Govt. stakeholders to develop SOPs that streamline processes and ensure consistency in service delivery acr oss different levels of the child protection system. 
 
6. Evidence Gathering for Scaling Up:  
 
• Systematically document successful processes and interventions from the pilot programs, highlighting their effectiveness and scalability.  
• Compile case studies and success stories to showcase tangible impact of the program on child protection outcomes.  
• Utilise monitoring and evaluation data to identify key lessons learned and areas for improvement, informing the design of fut ure scaling up efforts. 
 
7. Scaling in Targeted Districts: 
 
• Develop a phased approach for scaling the program in targeted districts, prioritising areas with the greatest need and potent ial for impact. 
• Establish clear milestones and performance indicators to track progress throughout the scaling process.  
• Continuously monitor implementation of the district and state levels, adjusting as necessary to address emerging challenges a nd capitalise opportunities for expansion. 
 
8. Understand cost and budget implications:  
 
As we progress, we will develop cost models outlining the resources required for government entities or other philanthropic o rganisations/NGOs to adopt and scale up our initiatives. 
This approach ensures that our efforts remain cost-effective and feasible for integration into existing systems, fostering smoother adoption of our program model within the bro ader 
framework. 
 
MEL Approach 
The implementing partners will conduct a vulnerability mapping exercise in each of the target villages. This will help to map  and identify all children in the villages; identifying at risk families 
and children and their participation in school education. This will also help us understand the current situation and getting a baseline, and setting clear targets for all implementing partners.  
 
The implementing partners will have dedicated Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Coordinators who will work in the project. They will report on pre- approved formats to the BAT MEL 
personnel housed in the project management unit (PMU, BAT) of the state. The reporting to the project monitoring unit by the implementing partners will be quarterly. Monthly reports will 
be asked by the PMU for better oversight purposes. For cases of survivors/ children in need of child protection (CNCP), the i mplementing partners will maintain data of plan of action and the 
current status along with data on each referral/reporting and outcome of the action. Summary of these will be submitted to th e PMU on a monthly basis. The PMU at the state level, along 
with technical partner in some cases, will undertake field visits, quality checks, audits, or other exercises to ensure data quality of the reported  data.  
   
BAT will onboard a specialised MEL partner to create standard protocols (SOP) and guidelines for all partners in the Monitoring system for COF/ Kawach programme. It will help in developing 
robust systems for data collection, tracking, and necessary course corrections, performing quality checks and recommend a detailed quality assurance plan going forward in the programme 
cycle, to ensure the work is standardised and uniformly applied across the partners. An MIS will be developed that will track each child who has been reported or identified as victim/survivor 
or potential victim of child marriage/ child labour/ child trafficking and child sexual abuse and track this child throughout the process of reintegration, the MIS will also automate the reporting 
and visualisation of the state programme and will have automated reports for block, partner, and state level.   
 
Phasing out strategy and sustainability plan 
The one-year plan outlined here serves as the foundational framework for a comprehensive initiative that will span the next decade ba sed on the successes and learnings acquired. This 
initiative is built on a systems -change approach, which means it focuses on creating lasting and sustainable change within the government’s system while simultaneously empowering 
communities, including survivors with particular challenges or issues. The overarching goal is to foster accountability among  those responsible for fulfilling their duties.  
 
Over the course of the next seven years, this proposed programme will strategically work towards fostering sustainable change s through social and economic transformations within the 
targeted communities and working with the government to build capacity in the child protection workforce as well as other allied departments. This will include better implementation of 
the existing policies such as Mission Vatslaya at various administrative levels, ranging from villages to blocks, districts, and state. Key stake holders in this process will include district 
administrations, District Child Protection Units (DCPUs), local child protection committees, SMCs and the school education de partment.  
A central element of this initiative is to motivate the gram panchayats (local self -governance bodies in rural India) to give greater priority and earmark budgetary resources specifically on 
child protection endeavours. Securing budgetary allocations under the Gram Panchayat Development Plan will ensure that communities and child protection co mmittees can independently 
plan and implement child protection initiatives. It will also empower them to take ownership of their development initiatives and reduce dep endency on external agencies.  
 
Sustainability: The progress characterises the ability of the community to own and take actions towards prevention from exploitation and vuln erability. British Asian Trust along with Praxis 
has developed certain tools like community maturity tool to empower the community groups by developing systems and process of collective learning within them.  
 
The impact of this programme will thus extend beyond its 10-year duration in creating stronger communities and accountable government systems. 
 
Role of the implementing partners (NGOs) 
 
The implementing partners will play a pivotal role in translating the project objectives into tangible actions and outcomes. Our implementing partners are: 
• Child Rights and You (CRY) 
• Suprava Panchashila Mahila Udyog Samity (SPMUS) 
• City Level Programme of Action for Street and Working Children (CLPOA) 
• Bal Surksha Abhiyan (BSA) 
 
The implementing partners will also co-create and execute tailored interventions such as facilitating collectivisation and building capacities of various stakeholders, conducting awareness 
campaigns, liaising with authorities from the village to the district level and provision of support services. 
 
Implementing partners will therefore facilitate community engagement, and forge trust, collaboration and convergence with duty bearers which is critical in tackling child rights 
violations and bringing about systems change. 
 
Role of Technical Partners 
The current implementing  partners in  West Bengal possess commendable community mobili sation and government engagement skills, forming the core of our program. To bolster their 
efforts, BAT aims to enlist technical partners who will augment interventions related to livelihood and education.   
 
Education:  
The objective is to enhance program delivery by leveraging the expertise of established models, ensuring effective outcomes  with cost efficiency. We are considering organisations such as 
Educate Girls, Pratham, and the American India Foundation (AIF). 
• To conduct a comprehensive needs/gap assessment, focusing on: 
• Re-enrolment of children in age-appropriate classes and bring them back to schools. 
• Management of "Remedial Coaching Centres" with support to community volunteers or PNGO's outreach workers. 
• Strategies to prevent school dropouts by improving scholastic performances and the teaching-learning process. 
• Enhancement of school safety and engagement with School Management Committees (SMCs). 
• Activation and sustainable functionality of SMCs through effective interventions. 
• Development and implementation of a capacity building plan for implementing partners. 
• Streamlining and standardising processes for education as a preventive measure for child protection. 
• Serving as a knowledge partner for education in the program. 
 
Social Protection Schemes and Livelihoods:  
Potential partners may include AIF, Pradhan, Access, Jan Sahas, Haqdarshaq or Ajeevika. 
The livelihoods technical partner will conduct a scoping study/systematic review the efficacy of the livelihood practices/ trades that can improve economic conditions of families of the children 
at risk; will help to align with the program's context and Theory of Change (ToC). This includes: 
 
• A comprehensive livelihoods assessment in program areas, with a focused intervention for increased livelihood opportunities and incomes. 
• Identification of alternative livelihoods, establishment of profitable livestock management practices, and building an ecosys tem for livestock. 
• Support in the rollout of appropriate technology in all interventions. 
• Technical support for scaling up cost-effective (short and medium term) and sustainable (long term) approaches to ensure households benefit from social protection schemes. 
• Assessment of the local economy, preparation of small business plans, orientation, and training on entrepreneurship developme nt. possess commendable community mobili sation and 
government engagement skills, forming the core of our program.  To bolster their efforts, BAT aims to enlist technical partners who will augment interventions related to livelihood and 
education. 
 
In West Bengal, we have also onboarded the technical partners: 
• Praajak 
• Ajeevika Bureau 
• Nirmana 
 
Prajaak has been extensively working to address gender inequalities by challenging traditional norms and notions of masculinity and patriarchy. Over the years, Praajak has worked with a 
range of child protection issues that include child trafficking, preventing and addressing unsafe migration, child sexual abuse, child, early and forced marriages, child work and labour. Prajaak 
works collectively with children and youth, the communities they live in, the Government and other organisations to create a caring  and protective environment for all children. They use a 
rights-based approach to support vulnerable children and youth to use thei r individual potential and agency. Prajaak will be working closely with the field teams, children’s collectives and 
communities to build their capacities in creating a gender equitable society. 
 
Ajeevika Bureau has rich experience in providing solutions, services, and security to a large population of India’s rural migrant workers. They combine direct service delivery, policy engagement, 
research, and technical support to advance the cause of migrant workers. Ajeevika Bureau has worked to provide lasting solutions to economic and socio-legal problems of migrant workers -  
directly as well as through partners - by creating replicable models offering services and security both at source and destination. In West Bengal, Ajeevika will be  conducting research on the 
migration trends from the tea gardens, focusing on the push and pull factors for migration and how the project can ensure safe migration.  
 
Nirmana initially provided logistic support to the National Campaign of Construction Workers, ensured participation of Constr uction Workers in the National Campaign by developing ties 
with them through awareness generation and providing childcare, educatio n, health care services, legal aid etc. across the slums of North -West District. Subsequently NIRMALA NIKETAN, a 
Domestic Workers collective was promoted to assist the tribal women and young girls who migrate or are trafficked for domesti c work to Delhi an d other urban centres. Now, NIRMANA 
addresses a gap in policy for social security and livelihoods space amongst unorganised sector workers to achieve its overall  vision of 'Building an Inclusive India’. Nirmana’ s expertise lies in 
empowering unorganised sector workers so that they are able to achieve social security and dignified livelihood. Nirmana under this programme is a resource organisation who will be working 
to connect migrant workers with social security schemes and entitlements especially under the building and construction workers act and Domestic workers act. They will also work closely  
with tea garden workers association to strengthen their social protections under the plantation act.  
 
These partners with their deep understanding of the local context will also help to identify vulnerable children and address the specific risks that these children and their families face.

Key stakeholders to be 
involved in the process 
Effective child protection strategies necessitate convergence between different government departments. The proposed programm e has 
identified the following key Uttar Pradesh stakeholders and organisations as some of the key agencies we need to work with: 
• Department of Women and Child Development 
• Education, labour, and panchayat and rural development, departments  
• Gram Panchayats (local self-government at village level)  
• Child protection committees (CPCs)  
• District child protection units (DCPUs)  
Project goal/aim Over the next 12 months, KAWACH will implement a holistic prevention model for reduction in prevalence of child marriage, chi ld 
labour, child trafficking, and exploitation. 
The project will: 
• Build economic resilience of vulnerable families through access to social security and livelihoods  
• Establish schools as safety nets and safe spaces for children 
• Strengthen community and government institutions 
Alignment with Kawach 
strategy and thematic areas 
The project aligns with the KAWACH strategy with a focus on prevention. It will specifically:  
• Build family and community resilience by addressing underlying drivers of vulnerability and re -integrating survivors.  
• Strengthen systems from village to state by creating safe spaces, building capacities of key government duty bearers, and oth er 
stakeholders.  
• Strengthen the child protection ecosystem through data and evidence, and by setting up multi -stakeholder platforms for 
collaboration.

Context and problem statement 
Uttar Pradesh has the largest population of children in India. It had the 3rd highest number of reported crimes against child ren (NCRB 2011). The state tops the tables when it 
comes to child rape and sexual abuse cases (NCRB 2011). Uttar Pradesh also had the highest reported child labour incidence (Census 2011). UP is among the top three states with 
the maximum number of children trafficked between 2016 and 2022. 1 It is among the 10 poorest performing states in heath & nutrition, Human Development Index and 
Multidimensional Poverty Index. 
Over the past few years, our programmes in Uttar Pradesh (UP) have supported adults and children working in brick kilns and bonded labour settings. Our partners have achieved 
significant success in working with the rescued children, the survivors along with their families which culminated in the establishment of a social capital comprising 30,000 survivors 
and community members across the state. 
Additionally, our partners have made notable strides in collaboration with the government by setting up a bonded labour track ing system in UP. They have also played a pivotal 
role in fostering a network for policy engagement in the region. 
 
1 Child Trafficking in India: Insights from Situational Data Analysis and the Need for Tech-driven Intervention Strategies', by Games24x7 and the Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation (KSCF)   
Building upon the knowledge and social capital gained from these initiatives, the proposed project now intends to implement a s a holistic prevention model across three districts 
and two blocks in each district of UP. This holistic model aims to address the multifaceted dimensions and needs of the communities by ensuring a comprehensive support system 
and integration with the government’s social care and development initiatives.  
The following achievements of our programme (data captured from September 2022 to February 2023) have guided our strategy for  the road ahead:   
• Activated 2500 child protection committees (CPCs) 
• Activated 75 school management committees (SMCs) in which a total of 5,670 dropouts were reconnected to school by regularising the DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) of children 
by holding monthly meetings. 
• Connected children of 7,680 survivors' families to school.  
• Supported 230 families with livelihood support. 
• Integrated child protection into Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDP). Ongoing interactions with panchayat representatives focus on strengthening panchayat-level child 
protection committees (PLCPCs) and raising awareness about children's issues within t he community. 
• 35 community vigilance committees have become activated to the level where they are sustainable and self -reliant  
• Budget of more than INR 12 lakh has been blocked for inserting child friendly indicators in Gram Panchayat Development Plan i n 249 GPs. 
• 65,560 Ayushman cards (Health Insurance) were made in collaboration with the government, in which 5,340 people were provided service in the hospital through the card. 
• 76 villages allocated budgetary resources to fight child labour. Though the amounts allocated were small, this was an importa nt first step towards ensuring that village 
leadership takes responsibility for the prevention of child labour.  
• Similarly, the government’s Ayushman Bharat scheme has immense potential to prevent debt bondage.  In Uttar Pradesh, a 2020 o rder by health department obtained by 
British Asian Trust grantee Rural Organisation for Social Advancement (ROSA), was extended by  the State government and, as a result, health insurance cards were issued to 
more than four million people throughout the state between January and March 2021.  A short study conducted by a civil societ y partner in 60 project villages illustrated how 
this led to positive change for millions across the state. 
These important pieces of learnings have influenced to upgrade our model and make it more comprehensive. The holistic model w ill address not only bonded labour issues but 
also other critical child protection issues which are affecting the well-being of the children in UP and making them vulnerable. 
Earlier, we were working in seven districts in eastern UP.  However, based on the new strategic plan, we will continue to work in two of these districts (Prayagraj and Chandauli), 
exit from five districts and add one new district (Balarampur). 
Project executive summary   
During the gating period, the project will consolidate learnings so far to pilot a holistic model which will implement three critical interventions in the same community: 
• Build economic resilience of vulnerable families through access to social security and livelihoods: By prioritising vulnerabl e families’ access to social security schemes covering 
health, livelihoods, education, we can address their basic needs. This will be done with support from District Child Protection Units (DCPUs) and Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). 
We will also link vulnerable families to alternative livelihood opportunities for increased household income. Once the bare minimum is solved for, providing access to alternative 
livelihoods will help families build positive aspirations, complement their incomes, and minimise the risk of them turning to detrimental practices like child labour, child marriage, 
and child trafficking   
• Using schools as safety nets and safe spaces: Safe and thriving learning environments indirectly mitigate risks of children f alling into child labour, child marriage, and unsafe 
migration. The project will undertake interventions to identify out of school children and ensure re-enrolment. All vulnerable children under the age of 14 will be supported to 
continue in school. 
• Strengthening community and governance institutions for structural, local, and timely response to child protection issues. This will include a systematic mapping and identification 
of all vulnerable children in the intervention districts, which will form the basis of tracking programme impact, success, and learnings.  
The project is built on evidence from our past work and stakeholder engagement at the local level. On one hand, this ensures that our programme is informed by real time 
insights into the impact of our work, while on the other, we are able to closely collaborate with the government to integrate  best practices and scale up initiatives implemented 
by our partners in pilot villages. Through effective stakeholder engagement, we seek to institutionalise successful interventions and  amplify their impact. 
This holistic strategy will be delivered on the ground by three partners namely MSEMVS, ROSA and Pragati Gramodyog Evam Samaj  Kalyan Sansthan (PGS). 
We will also integrate and align Community Vigilance Committees (CVCs) and Azad Sakthi Group (Survivor federations), a unique  community-level protection mechanism by our 
UP partners, with CPCs as per mission Vatsalya. The CVCs consist of champions of child  protection, utilise non-violent community organising strategies to combat child trafficking 
and ensure accountability from authorities in upholding human rights. These CVCs have transformed their communities, reduced corruption, empowered women, enhanced 
education, and expanded access to essential services. They have made significant strides in reducing child trafficking, and in well-established CVC areas, trafficking has been halted 
altogether. CVCs stand as a powerful force in the fight against child tra fficking and the promotion of child protection and create a lasting impact on the communities they serve. 
Until now, CVCs have been focusing on labour trafficking and migration. Going forward, our partners will build their capaciti es to work on all child rights violations.  
We will also work with Technical partners such as Educate Girls or Pratham that have a track record of effective implementati on of sub-strategies relevant to KAWACH. They will 
provide technical support to BAT’s implementing partners on programme monitoring, evaluation, progress measurement and documentation of data. They will also help to ensure 
standardisation of programme approaches and enhance programme equality amongst all the implementation partners.    
BAT will collect all reports and relevant data from all the partners (implementing or technical), and be the link between tec hnical partners and implementation partners thereby 
also acting as the repository for knowledge and tools being developed in the pr ogramme.

Scale-up plan  
The scale-up of best practices in UP will be executed by carefully identifying policy interventions, working collaboratively, and engaging with key identified government stakeholders 
from village to state level.  The approach we will take is reflected in one of our success stories - inclusion of child labour prevention in Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs)   
In August 2021, the Government of India's Ministry of Panchayati Raj initiated a people's campaign titled ‘Sabki Yojna Sabka Vikas’ and provided guidelines for activities to be 
undertaken by states from July 30, 2021, to January 31, 2022. The government of Uttar Pradesh, in response to this directive,  mandated the development of Gram Panchayat 
Development Plans (GPDP) between October 2, 2021, and January 31, 2022.  
1. MSEMVS's strategic intervention: 
• MSEMVS, recognising the opportunity for change, approached the District Panchayati Raj Officers in all 5 project districts.  
• It submitted a fact sheet on child protection consisting of data and evidence. 
• It sought to include child labour prevention and child protection in GPDPs and allocate a budget at the village panchayat lev el. 
 
2. Multi-layered government engagement: 
• Our partner adopted a three-pronged approach: engagement with Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI), block authorities, and district authorities.  
• It engaged village panchayats to include child labour prevention in their GPDP.  
• It also enabled women's groups, children's groups, and vulnerable groups to amplify their voices, ensuring that the issues of  marginalised populations were included 
in the GPDP. 
•  MSEMVS conducted meetings with District Panchayat Raj Officers (DPROs) to issue circulars that directed village and block panchayats  to include child labour 
prevention in GPDP. 
 
3. State-level engagement: 
• In a significant move, a delegation of UP partners met the Upper Chief Secretary of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj.  
• They submitted a memorandum asking for child labour and child protection inclusion in GPDPs, along with a budget allocation o f ₹ 10,000 for each Gram Panchayat 
in the state. 
• The Upper Chief Secretary accepted the memorandum, marking a substantial win for child protection.  
 
4. Collaborative stakeholder engagement  
• Simultaneously, the partners continued collaborative efforts with state Labour and Women and Child Welfare Departments. The collaborative approach was deemed 
crucial for success. 
 
5. Block and district levels engagement: 
• The partner organisation actively engaged with block authorities responsible for the GPDP. Block authorities have the authori ty to allocate budgets for essential 
welfare issues in GPDPs. 
• Child labour prevention was presented as an important issue, leading to strong engagement at both block and district levels.  
 
6. Successfully creating provisions for child protection in the GPDPs: 
• The partner engaged with officials in 8 blocks across five districts, resulting in the inclusion of child labour prevention w ork and relevant budgets in their respective 
GPDPs. 
• Approximately 650 villages were involved, benefiting more than 16,250 families, and promoting grassroots anti-child labour initiatives with gram panchayat resources. 
   
This success story showcases the power of systematic engagement and collaboration in influencing positive change in child lab our prevention and protection at the grassroots 
level in Uttar Pradesh. Similar achievements were seen in Adoption of School manage ment committee modules within the government module and scale up of social security 
scheme linkages through Mega camps.  
British Asian Trust and its NGO partners in UP will capture the learnings and focus on replicating the approaches in their re spective areas of intervention during the gating period 
and will further scale up efforts over the next 6-7 years. 
 
MEL Approach 
(Also refer MEL plan from IM annexes file) 
  
The implementing partners will conduct a vulnerability mapping exercise in each of the target villages, this will help map an d identify all children in the villages; identifying at risk 
families and children and their participation in school education.  Th is will also help us in understanding the current situation and getting a baseline, and setting clear targets for 
all implementing partners.  
The implementing partners will have dedicated Monitoring Evaluation & Learning Coordinators who will work in the project. They will report on pre- approved formats to the BAT 
MEL personnel housed in the project management unit (PMU, BAT) of the state. The reporting to the project monitoring unit by the implementing partners will be quarterly. 
Monthly reports will be asked by the PMU for better oversight purposes. For cases of survivors/ children in need of child protection (CNCP), the implementing partners will maintain 
data of plan of action and the current status along with data on each referral/reporting and outcome of the action. Summary o f these will be submitted to the PMU monthly. The 
PMU at the state level, along with technical partner in some cases, will undertake field visits, quality checks, audits or other exercises to ensure data quality of the reported data.  
  
BAT will onboard a specialised MEL partner to create standard protocols (SOP) and guidelines for all partners in the Monitoring system for COF/ Kawach programme. It will help in 
developing robust systems for data collection, tracking, and necessary course corrections, performing quality checks and recommend a detailed quality assurance plan going 
forward in the programme cycle, to ensure the work is standardised and uniformly applied across the partners. An MIS will be developed that will track each child w ho has been 
reported or identified as victim/survivor or potential victim of child marriage/ child labour/ child trafficking and child se xual abuse and track this child throughout the process of 
reintegration, the MIS will also automate the reporting and visualisation of the state programme and will have automated reports for block, partner, and state level.  
 
Phasing out strategy and sustainability plan   
The one-year plan outlined in the document would serve as the foundational framework for a comprehensive initiative that will extend over next 7 years. This initiative is built on 
a systems-change approach and will focus on creating lasting and sustainable changes within the government system while simultaneously be empowering communities, including 
survivors who may be facing particular challenges. The overarching goal is to foster accountability among those responsible f or performing their duties. 
 
Over the course of the next five years, this proposed programme will strategically work towards influencing the quality imple mentation of existing policies at the best interest of 
the children at every level of our administrative structure ranging from vil lages to blocks to districts and even the state level. Key stakeholders in this process will include school 
management committees, the education department, labour department, ward and district administrations, Mission Vatsalya (District Child Protection Units - DCPUs), Panchayati 
& Rural Development Department, Home (Police) Department, and the broader education sector.  
 
A central element of this initiative is to encourage gram panchayats to earmark budgetary resources specifically for child protection endeavours. This allocation of funds empowers 
communities to independently plan and implement activities, reducing their r eliance on external donors.  Some examples of local resource  
• Schools:   
o Ensure separate toilets for boys and girls, provide facilities for practicing safer menstrual hygiene, and maintaining adequate classrooms with government-prescribed 
teacher-student ratios. These measures are crucial for preventing children from dropping out of school.  
• Panchayats: 
o Ensure the social and economic rehabilitation of survivors of trafficking and gender -based violence (GBV) and provide them psycho-social support as necessary. 
o Enhance access to social protection schemes for vulnerable families, which in turn promote economic resilience within the com munities. 
o Collaborate with Block administration to institutionalise the migration register, which will help track the migration of peop le from the targeted blocks under Kawach 
intervention. This data is vital for effective policy planning and ensuring the welfare of  migrant workers. 
 
By fostering sustainable changes within the government system, engaging communities in the process, and encouraging local budgetary allocations, this initiative aims to create a 
long-lasting legacy of improved child protection, education, and community emp owerment. The changes introduced during this period are intended to endure and positively 
influence the well-being of communities for many years to come. 
 
Role of the implementing partner(s) 
MSEMVS, PGS and ROSA will serve as the primary implementing organisations for holistic models in two districts - Chandauli (2 blocks, 121 villages) and Prayagraj (2 blocks, 88 
villages). These partners will operate at the grassroots level, extending support to vulnerable famil ies through various means, including livelihood programmes, education 
initiatives, tracking mechanisms, awareness campaigns, and capacity -building efforts. They will also collaborate with local collectives and systems such as child pro tection 
committees (CPC), school management committees (SMC), self-help groups (SHGs), and more. In year one, partners will work in 10% of the villages in each block and scale up next 
year to more villages. 
Role of technical partner 
The current implementing partners in Uttar Pradesh (UP) possess commendable community mobilisation and government engagement skills, forming the core of our programme. 
To bolster their efforts, BAT aims to enlist technical partners who will augment interve ntions related to livelihood and education. 
 
Education:  The objective is to enhance programmes delivery by leveraging the expertise of established models, ensuring effective outcome s with cost efficiency. We are 
considering organisations such as Educate Girls, Pratham, and the American India Foundation (AIF).  
To conduct a comprehensive needs/gap assessment, focusing on: 
• Re-enrolment of children in age-appropriate classes and bring them back to schools. 
• Management of "Remedial Coaching Centres" with support to community volunteers or PNGO's outreach workers.  
• Strategies to prevent school dropouts by improving scholastic performances and the teaching -learning process. 
• Enhancement of school safety and engagement with School Management Committees (SMCs).  
• Activation and sustainable functionality of SMCs through effective interventions.  
• Development and implementation of a capacity building plan for implementing partners.  
• Streamlining and standardising processes for education as a preventive measure for child protection.  
• Serving as a knowledge partner for education in the programme. 
 
Social Protection Schemes and Livelihoods:  Potential partners may include: AIF, Pradhan, Access, Jan Sahas, Adarsha or Ajeevika.  
   
• The livelihoods technical partner will conduct a scoping study/systematic review the efficacy of the livelihood practices/ tr ades that can improve economic conditions of 
families of the children at risk; will help to align with the programme's context and Theory of Change (ToC). This includes: 
• A comprehensive livelihoods assessment in programme areas, with a focused intervention for increased livelihood opportunities  and incomes. 
• Identification of alternative livelihoods, establishment of profitable livestock management practices, and building an ecosys tem for livestock. 
• Support in the rollout of appropriate technology in all interventions.  
• Technical support for scaling up cost -effective (short and medium term) and sustainable (long term) approaches to ensure households benefit from social protection 
schemes. 
• Assessment of the local economy, preparation of small business plans, orientation, and training on entrepreneurship developme nt.

Target geographies Jaipur (urban) 
(The urban geography was intentionally chosen to add diversity to the sample, initiating program mes to establish a proof of concept) 
Key target population  8250 children as direct beneficiaries, 20495 indirect beneficiaries and more than 70,000 households including women, children, and 
relevant duty bearers. 
Key stakeholders to be involved 
in the process 
To create a sustainable ecosystem for child protection, it is important to set up an effective convergence between different 
government departments who are directly responsible for ensuring the rights of the children. The proposed programme has identified 
the Departments of Women and Child Development, Education, Labour and Home/Police and the District Child Protection Units 
(DCPUs) as key agencies we need to work with. 
Project goal/aim Over the next 12 months, KAWACH will implement a holistic prevention model for reduction in prevalence of child marriage, child 
labour, child trafficking, and exploitation. 
The project will: 
• Build economic resilience of vulnerable families through access to social security and livelihoods  
• Establish schools as safety nets and safe spaces for children 
• Strengthen community and government institutions 
Alignment with Kawach strategy 
and thematic areas 
The project aligns with the KAWACH strategy with a focus on prevention. It will specifically:  
• Build family and community resilience by addressing underlying drivers of vulnerability and re -integrating survivors.  
• Strengthen systems from village to state by creating safe spaces, building capacities of key government duty bearers, and 
other stakeholders.  
• Strengthen the child protection ecosystem through data and evidence, and by setting up multi -stakeholder platforms for 
collaboration.

Refer to Annexure 
MEL approach  
(Also refer to MEL plan from IM annexes file) 
    
The implementing partners will conduct a vulnerability mapping exercise in each of the target villages. This will help to map and 
identify all children in the villages; identifying at risk families and children and their participation in school education.   This will also 
help us in understanding the current situation and getting a baseline and setting clear targets for all implementing partners.  
The implementing partners will have dedicated Monitoring Evaluation & Learning Coordinators who will work in the project. The y will 
report on pre- approved formats to the BAT MEL personnel housed in the project management unit (PMU, BAT) of the state. The 
reporting to the project monitoring unit by the implementing partners will be quarterly. Monthly reports will be asked by the  PMU for 
better oversight purposes. For cases of survivors/ children in need of child protection (CNCP), the implementing partners will maintain 
data of plan of action and the current status along with data on each referral/reporting and outcome of the action. Summary o f these 
will be submitted to the PMU on a monthly basis. The PMU at the state level, along with technical partner in some cases, will 
undertake field visits, quality checks, audits or other exercises to ensure data quality of the reported data.  
  
BAT will onboard a specialised MEL partner to create standard protocols (SOP) and guidelines for all partners in the Monitori ng system 
for COF/ Kawach. It will help in developing robust systems for data collection, tracking, and necessary course correction s, performing 
quality checks and recommend a detailed quality assurance plan going forward in the programme cycle, to ensure the work is 
standardised and uniformly applied across the partners. An MIS will be developed that will track each child who has bee n reported or 
identified as victim/survivor or potential victim of child marriage/ child labour/ child trafficking and child sexual abuse a nd track this 
child throughout the process of reintegration. The MIS will also automate the reporting and visualisation of the state programme and 
will have automated reports for block, partner, and state level. 
 
Phasing out strategy and 
sustainability plan   
The one-year plan outlined here serves as the foundational framework for a comprehensive initiative that  will give us the direction of 
urban centric child protection model and could be replicated in other urban locations like Delhi which is a key location for Kawach.   
This initiative is built on a systems-change approach, which means it focuses on creating lasting and sustainable changes within the 
government system while simultaneously empowering communities, including survivors of particular challenges or issues. The 
overarching goal is to foster accountability among those responsible for fulfilling their duties.  
Strategy for ensuring sustainability in this region involves bolstering household income through the establishment of liveliho od 
opportunities, such as women-led industries and the formation of self-help groups. The programme also places a strong emphasis on 
education, where our partner concentrates on improving schools by strengthening school management committees (SMCs) and 
integrating initiatives to safeguard children and enhance their educational experience  thus ensuring enrolment and retention of 
children in schools. 
Why is this a good project for 
Kawach  
• Focuses on the most vulnerable children   
• Aligned with our new strategy, theory of change and cascade to impact.   
• Focused on community ownership of the prevention model as well as strengthening government systems  
• Creating a proof of concept in urban setting

Context and problem statement 
Rajasthan has the 6th highest number of reported crimes against children1 and the 9th highest number of child marriage incidents2 (NFHS -V). It also has the 3rd highest number of 
child labourers according to Census 2011. Between 2018 and 2022, the state reported the highest incidence (23%) of child traf ficking as per MHA3 data. It remains among the 10 
poorest performing states in relation to gender equality, and does poorly on Human Development Index 4 and Multidimensional Poverty Index5 (SDG – 1,2, 3, 4, 5 & 10). 
Despite consolidated efforts by state, central governments, and NGOs, the prevalence of child labour persists in the state, i nfluenced by various factors.  
Within urban Jaipur we will focus on two slums. Selection of these slums was based on a baseline assessment conducted by Development Solutions, identifying vulnerable hotspots 
in Jaipur characterised by significant child rights violations, including child labour trafficking and a high number of out -of-school children. These pockets also exhibit a notable 
percentage of minority population. 
In Jaipur, artisan and craft industries employ children in small -scale, unregulated family businesses. Seasonal migration from drought -prone rural areas to Jaipur exposes migrant 
children to the risk of forced labour due to poverty and limited access to ed ucation and social welfare. Identified hotspots are also susceptible to riots, impacting children's 
education. Barriers to school enrolment have multiplied post -pandemic, compounded by cultural factors discouraging parents from sending their children to sc hool. Moreover, a 
significant portion of the population works in the informal sector, facing challenges in accessing social security benefits, often compelling children to engage in labour at an early 
age. 
Jaipur's distinctive urban setting demands a comprehensive approach encompassing prevention, responsiveness, and rehabilitati on. The multipronged strategy includes 
establishing child -labour resilient neighbourhoods through SEWA Shakti Kendra’s (SSKs) and c ommunity empowerment. This involves empowering youth groups to discuss 
children's rights and cultivating grassroots women leaders (Agyewans) to enhance marginalised communities' access to social a nd health security, ensuring formal education for 
their children. 
Additionally, the programme will focus on strengthening innovative livelihood models in identified hotspot areas to prevent l ocal children from entering labour. Efforts extend to 
fortifying schools within these hotspots to retain children and create safe s paces for their well -being. Psycho-social support, care, and guidance are provided, particularly for 
children rescued from labour and survivors of forced marriage or trafficking, facilitating their intellectual, emotional, and  social development. 
Furthermore, the youth in the communities will be empowered through education and vocational training, leading to increased a wareness and accountability towards children in 
their areas. The goal is the adoption of these interventions into systems through e vidence-based policy engagement and systemic capacity-building. 
 
Our previous work in Rajasthan has predominantly centred on the Child Labour Free Jaipur programme which focused on rescue and rehabilitation of child labourers by facilitating 
prosecution of the offenders and supporting the survivors. While that work has yielded significant results by providing livelihood and rehabilitation for survivors and conviction of 
the offenders, we also saw that there was a high rate of re -trafficking of children if nothing was done to change the situation of children and their fam ilies at source. Hence, 
although we will continue to support rescued children in Jaipur to ensure they get re -integrated, our focus has now shifted to prevention.

Over the last year some key achievements have been: 
• 1085 children rescued in Jaipur, with 107 rescued in transit from Bihar and 978 from workplaces in Jaipur.    
• Trauma-informed counselling provided to 928 children at 8 police stations in Jaipur.  
• Inter-state coordination established for restoring children from Jaipur to Bihar.  
• 803 police personnel trained and legal assistance provided to 230 child labour cases.  
• 261 children testified, with 89 bail pleas contested and 51 refused to grant bail.  
• Quality institutional care ensured for 596 rescued children in Jaipur.  
• 808 rescued survivors from Jaipur reintegrated with their families in Bihar, with digitised legal documentation.  
• 141 self-help groups (SHGs) have been formed by partners working on livelihoods and two producer companies engaging 610 women in inter mittent work on textile 
stitching embroidery and lacquer products.   
Project Summary: 
Building on our achievements in Jaipur and guided by our new strategy, we plan to enhance our prevention efforts in the urban  slums of Jaipur. While all our projects in other 
states are village-focused, Jaipur will remain an urban-centric intervention, enabling us to pilot our prevention-led model in urban areas. We will work with partners like Pardarshita, 
SEWA Bharat, Access, LEDS, Centre for Child Protection (CCP), TAABAR in Jaipur to achieve outcomes. 
Main activities to be undertaken under the project 
The project adopts a comprehensive approach to child protection and welfare, addressing multiple crucial areas. In its initial phase, the work in Rajasthan will focus on the following 
interconnected streams: 
 
Strengthen Economic Resilience of Families: Taking advantage of Jaipur’s textile and craft industry ACEES and SEWA will work towards providing sustainable livelihoods.  
1) Develop institutions by strengthening women's entrepreneurship within the Producer Company, ensuring sustainable business pra ctices: 
• Provide skill development opportunities. 
• Enhance the child labour-free production process. 
• Establish sustainable market linkages. 
• Enable women artisans to leverage government schemes and facilitate Self -Help Group (SHG) women in accessing credit from formal financial sources.  
• Empower women with skills to make products more marketable, connect to schemes enhancing income, and earn better wages through the Producer Company, thereby 
providing sustainable livelihoods. This, in turn, keeps children away from work and encourages scho ol enrolment, elevating women's respect in households and 
involvement in decision-making. 
2) Connect Families to social security schemes: 
• Train family members in skill-based trades for income generation. 
• Facilitate the formation of SHGs and explore alternative livelihood options. 
• Establish a Women Producer Company. 
Reducing dropouts and creating safe spaces within schools:   
•  Conduct school social audits.   
• Identify and enrol out-of-school children. 
• Organise regular remedial coaching classes through bridge education centres.  
• Collaborate with school administration, parents, and school management committees to ensure safe and conducive learning envir onments. 
• Track child retention rates in schools. 
Implement collectivisation strategies: 
• Create children's collectives and conduct life skills sessions. 
• Organise community meetings and forums with stakeholders. 
• Hold regular community meetings to discuss child protection issues.  
• Establish forums for open dialogue, allowing community members to share concerns and ideas.  
• Capacity building on Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) for parents, youth, and other community -level stakeholders. 
• Form core groups of children, parents, and community stakeholders to act as influencers within their communities.  
Post-Rescue Care: 
• House rescued and at-risk children. 
• Improve nutrition to support age-appropriate physical and emotional development. 
• Engage children in personality-building and skill-building activities like sports, music, and dance. 
• Provide basic linguistic and numeric education. 
• Offer earning opportunities. 
• Provide mental health counselling and support for reintegration. 
• Provide end to end case management  
• Connect with our partners in Bihar to track rehabilitation of the children (In areas where our partners are available)  
Enhancing Capabilities of Key Stakeholders: 
• Collaborate with government and local institutions to strengthen governance, encourage service delivery accountability, and i mplement an evidence-based approach. 
• Engage with various entities such as Child Welfare Committees, CPC, District Administration, Law Enforcement Agencies, Labour Department, Department of Child Rights, 
Women & Child Development, Social Justice and Empowerment Department, Education Department , and Health Department. 
• Promote transparency and child protection standards. 
• Establish documentation mechanisms and model approaches for dealing with children in child -friendly environments in communities, schools, and Childcare Institutes.

Moving from neighbourhoods to the state  
In Rajasthan, our lead partner, the Centre for Child Protection (CCP) at Sardar Patel Police University, will play a crucial role in expanding our interventions to a systemic level. The 
CCP has been instrumental in arranging meetings with various stakehold ers like: Education, Police, Legal Service Authority, Panchayati Raj etc. They have also helped promote 
cooperation and collaboration between these departments. Additionally, they will create a platform for providing training to various stakeholders. Over the next year, CCP will 
continue its support to expand best practices (like SMC trainings) and interventions carried out by Pardarshita and SEWA in t he fields of education and women and child welfare 
further enhancing our endeavours in child protection at the systemic level. 
To achieve these outcomes, we will take on a holistic community -based and prevention-led model. Some guiding principles of our model are:   
• Address stakeholder capacity gaps using community driven strategy:  The CCP programme in Jaipur identified significant skill deficiencies among various stakeholders including 
grassroot functionaries within healthcare, education, law enforcement agencies, which resulted in mishandled cases and reduced prosecution rates. We will strengthen the system 
by analysing the practices followed in court and by police and developing SOPs for them to follow for better implementation o f legal processes. During this gating  period while 
continuing to work on child labour, CCP will initiate work on strengthening initiatives on child marriage by conducting needs  assessment with the police and designing a tool to 
support them in implementation of the law. CCP will also work with Pardarshita and SEWA for implementation of child protection committees and school management committees. 
CCP will pilot initiatives of CPC and SMC with Pardarshita and SEWA which will be used to design modules. These modules will then be implemented at d istrict level with the 
support of education and municipality department.  
• Promote evidence-based stakeholder engagement: The programme underscores the importance of engagement with systems for policy change based on robust evidence, aiming 
to enhance the implementation of child protection initiatives. Our partners conducted comprehensive studies to gather data on  crucial child protection aspects. This has helped 
us offer well-informed recommendations and insights to enhance programme implementation for example a handbook on documentation of cases fo r police on child trafficking, 
school social audits report etc. These data -informed approaches led to productive engagements with relevant government departments which resulted in a lot of changes in the 
schools and FIRs documentation. 
• Effective data management:  Partners worked with the CWC and supported them in digitisation of data by creating soft copies of documents of rescued child ren and creating a 
database of children in need of care and protection. 
• Enhance collaboration and coordination:  The programme showcased the necessity of cooperation among various government departments and stakeholders to streamline 
delivery of government services and ensure that social security benefits reach the most deserving families.  
Role of the implementing Partner/s (NGOs) 
1. Pardarshita is a non -profit organisation founded by group of like -minded people working on pro -poor governance. It was registered in 29th December 2005 under Societies 
Registration Act 1860 and also registered under FCRA with Ministry of Home Affairs, GOI.  The organisation began its journey with the aim of ensuring accountability in the public 
governance system by empowering the marginalised sections of society specifically focusing on women and children so that they can avail basic human rights and quality education 
to live with peace and dignity. Pardarshita is working with urban poor and marginalised in Delhi as well as in rural areas of  Jaipur and Uttar Pradesh. With BAT, Pardarshita has 
been working extensively on enrolling out-of-school children back into schools. It also runs bridge education centers in strategic neighborhoods where the number of out-of-school 
children is very high, such as Shastri Nagar and Ramganj. They have had a critical role in improving infrastructure of school s and transforming them into child safe spaces. They 
also work with parents and families through SMCs and CPCs in these neighborhoods.  Pardarshita has core expertise in educatio n and will support other partners in conducting 
school safety audits and SMC trainings in the district, 
2. SEWA Bharath –Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA), meaning "service" in several Indian languages, is a trade union based in Ahmedabad, Indi a, that promotes the rights 
of low-income, independently employed female workers. Nearly 2 million workers are m embers of SEWA across eight states in India. With BAT, SEWA supports us in providing an 
essential intervention in our prevention -led work is improving the economic resilience of families to ensure that children are not forced to become the breadwinners o f their 
households. SEWA works with women to strengthen financial circumstances of families. It runs awareness campaigns, helps women  organise themselves into SHGs and holds 
capacity building training for these women so that they can be linked to various liv elihood and social security schemes. SEWA uses these SHGs as key messengers on child rights 
protection information the community. The SHG women are trained using a module on child labour. We are looking at expanding t he scope of this work to other child ri ghts 
violations, thus spreading awareness among approximately 1200 women.    
3. Access –ACCESS is a national livelihoods support organisation, with focus on incubating innovations for sustainable livelihoods of th e poor. With support from DFID (Govt. of UK), 
ACCESS was established in March 2006 as a professional new generation agency to contribute to and support poverty reduction in India.  By accelerating collaborative action with 
global, regional, and local stakeholders, ACCESS is driving financial resilience and security as key outcomes. ACCESS has bui lt strong competencies over the years by building a 
community of practice around inclusive finance, generating evidence, convening regional and global programmes, supporting thought leadership and building a professional team. 
To achieve outcome-based impact, ACCESS pursues a 3-tier approach: 
 
• Tier I – Improve value chains through innovation and digitisation  
• Tier II – Empower stakeholders through capacity building and evidence generation  
• Tier III – Support narratives through consultations and publications  
With BAT, Access will work with women from marginalised communities and provide skill training in stitching, embroidery and b angle making. It links these skilled women to 
producer companies where they can earn wages for their work. They have played a cruci al role in ensuring industries such as bangle making and embroidery in Jaipur, which are 
the biggest enablers of child labour, are moving towards being completely child labour free. Access over the last three years  has created a women producer company whic h 
provides employment to 200 people with a turnover of approximately 50 lakhs The support this year is focused on seting up pra ctices so that women can manage the unit by 
themselves from the profit that they are making.  
4. Centre for Child Protection (CCP) – In the year 2015, SPUP established Centre for Child Protection with the vision that child, everywhere, must be accepted as a subject of right 
rather than as capital and / or as an asset.The centre, within the span of four years has developed its image internationally because of the following activities:  
o  To assess the systems and sub-systems of protection of children from formal and informal threats as well as visible and invisible threats  
o  To interpret various legal provisions associated with child’s protection  
o  To make academic efforts for formation of democratic and just Indian society in which child could act freely and fearlessly w ith creativity. 
To achieve the above objectives, CCP, through meaningful partnerships with various child rights actors, organizes research activities, capacity -building programmes, academic 
programmes, and takes actionable roles. CCP also strives to develop trained and skilled human resources so that efforts for protecting  children could move towards the desired 
direction. CCP is considered a 'center for eminence,' enabling communication and the spread of values such as tolerance, peace, and non-violence, without which child protection 
cannot become a reality. With BAT, CCP works on capacity building with various stakeholders such as CPCs, SMCs, police, law enforcement agencies, district officials like the DCPU, 
and public prosecutors. They also conduct in-depth child safety awareness campaigns to empower and capacitate institutions directly dealing with children. Additionally, they have 
undertaken intensive work on post -rescue counselling for child labour and methodologies to support the mental well -being of vulnerable children. Moving forward,  CCP will play 
a crucial role in institutionalizing practices established by our on-ground partner organizations. They will conduct a study on child marriage and leverage their position in the system 
to ensure convergence meetings. 
TAABAR – TAABAR runs shelter homes in Jaipur for rescued and at-risk children. At these homes, it focuses on the overall health and wellbeing of children – from nutrition to socio-
emotional development to mental health. It also works towards rehabilitating  rescued children back into their native communities. 
Role of technical partner   
In the context of a technical partnership for a programme in Rajasthan, our approach involves collaboration with various part ners, each contributing unique skills and expertise. 
For instance, Pardarshita specialises in education and school development, par ticularly in the urban settings of Jaipur slums, with a focus on strengthening schools and providing 
remedial education. Additionally, SEWA and Access play pivotal roles in enhancing the livelihoods of vulnerable community mem bers in Jaipur. While SEWA con centrates on 
strengthening Self-Help Groups (SHGs), Access works towards developing child labour-free products through women producer companies. The Center for Child Protection, affiliated 
with Sardar Patel Police University, serves as a key entity with th e primary objective of reinforcing systems based on insights gained from the experiences of these three 
organisations. 
The current implementing partners in Rajasthan possess commendable community mobilisation and government engagement skills, forming the core of our programme. To bolster 
their efforts, BAT aims to enlist technical partners who will augment interventions related to livelihood and education.  
 
Education:  The objective is to enhance programmes delivery by leveraging the expertise of established models, ensuring effective outcome s with cost efficiency. We are 
considering organisations such as Educate Girls, Pratham, and the American India Foundation (AIF).  
To conduct a comprehensive needs/gap assessment, focusing on: 
• Re-enrolment of children in age-appropriate classes and bring them back to schools. 
• Management of "Remedial Coaching Centres" with support to community volunteers or PNGO's outreach workers.  
• Strategies to prevent school dropouts by improving scholastic performances and the teaching -learning process. 
• Enhancement of school safety and engagement with School Management Committees (SMCs).  
• Activation and sustainable functionality of SMCs through effective interventions.  
• Development and implementation of a capacity building plan for implementing partners.  
• Streamlining and standardising processes for education as a preventive measure for child protection.  
• Serving as a knowledge partner for education in the programme. 
 
Social Protection Schemes and Livelihoods: Potential partners may include: AIF, Pradhan, Access, Jan Sahas, Adarsha or Ajeevika.  
 
• The livelihoods technical partner will conduct a scoping study/systematic review the efficacy of the livelihood practices/ tr ades that can improve economic conditions of 
families of the children at risk; will help to align with the programme's context and Theory of Change (ToC). This includes: 
• A comprehensive livelihoods assessment in programme areas, with a focused intervention for increased livelihood opportunities  and incomes. 
• Identification of alternative livelihoods, establishment of profitable livestock management practices, and building an ecosys tem for livestock. 
• Support in the rollout of appropriate technology in all interventions. 
• Technical support for scaling up cost -effective (short and medium term) and sustainable (long term) approaches to ensure households benefit from social protection 
schemes. 
• Assessment of the local economy, preparation of small business plans, orientation, and training on entrepreneurship developme nt.

Target geographies In line with our new programme strategy, we have narrowed the operational focus of our holistic prevention model in Bihar to four districts - 
Sitamarhi, Darbhanga, Katihar and Gaya. Each of the districts belong to different divisions in the state 1. 
We selected the four districts from among the 24 districts where we have operated to date, after taking into consideration critical factors like 
vulnerability of communities and children, strengths of previous investments, government collaborations, and potential repercussions on local 
communities. 
We will phase out over a period of 6-12 months from the rest of the areas to minimise disruption of existing prevention and survivor reintegration 
efforts. 
Following is the number of blocks and villages we will be targeting from the four districts:

No. of blocks Planned 2 1 2 1 
Total no. of villages 25 10 25 10 
 
Key target population During the gating period, we will directly target 24800 households and ~ 1,14,000 individuals 
Additionally, we will also support 1,215 survivors across a wider number of districts over the next two years in building leadership among survivors. 
*The current number is calculated based on 2011 census, total population in 70 villages - numbers to be confirmed within a month of proposal 
finalisation. 
 
1 Structurally Bihar is divided into divisions (Pramandal ), districts (Zila), sub-divisions (Anumandal) & circles (Anchal). The state is divided into 9 divisions and 38 districts 
     
     
     
  
Key stakeholders to be 
involved in the process 
Effective child protection strategies necessitate convergence between different government departments. The proposed programme has identified 
the following key Bihar state stakeholders and organisations as some of the key agencies we need to work with: 
• Department of Women and Child Development 
• Department of Education 
• Department of Labour 
• Panchayat, and Rural Development departments  
• Gram Panchayats (local self-government at village level) 
• District child protection units (DCPUs) 
• State Commission for Protection of Child Rights 
• Bihar Rural Livelihood Mission -Jeevika 
• Office of the District Magistrate (ADM Development) 
Project goal/aim Over the next 12 months, KAWACH will implement a holistic prevention model for reduction in prevalence of child marriage, child labour, child 
trafficking, and exploitation. 
The project will: 
• Build economic resilience of vulnerable families through access to social security and livelihoods 
• Establish schools as safety nets and safe spaces for children 
• Strengthen community and government institutions 
Alignment with KAWACH 
strategy and thematic areas 
The project aligns with the KAWACH strategy with a focus on prevention, specifically: 
• Build family and community resilience by addressing underlying drivers of vulnerability and re-integrating survivors. 
• Strengthen systems from village to state by creating safe spaces, building capacities of key government duty bearers, and other stakeholders.

2 Child Trafficking in India: Insights from Situational Data Analysis and the Need for Tech-driven Intervention Strategies', by Games24x7 and the Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation 
 
Context and problem statement 
Bihar is among the 10 poorest performing states in relation to education, gender equality, health & nutrition, Human Development Index and Multidimensional Poverty Index.  
These macro indicators are pre-empted and aggravated by the state of Bihar’s children. It has the 8th highest number of  reported crimes against children (NCRB 2021), and the 2nd highest incidents 
of child marriage (NFHS V) & child labour (Census 2011) in the country. The school dropout rate too is the 3rd highest (UDISE). According to a recent report2, Bihar is among the top three states with 
the maximum number of children trafficked between 2016 and 2022. 
In the post-COVID period, we have seen a disturbing rise in trafficking and migration from Bihar to Jaipur in Rajasthan for child labour. 
A 2022 evaluation of the Child Labour Free Jaipur project revealed alarming statistics. Child labour was found to be prevalent in 31% of units in Jaipur, a staggering 100% increase from 2018. Additionally, 
42% of these units employed adolescents, a 61% increase from 2018. To avoid detection and prosecution, these business units have adapted various methods, such as shifting operations of bangle 
production units that employ children to Bihar. Moreover, some of these businesses are functioning under the guise of family-owned units, where children can be made to work without scrutiny. This 
situation underscores the pressing need for prevention efforts in Bihar to support families to overcome their vulnerabilities  that pressurise them to send their children to work. 
 
Over the last year, the programme spanned 24 districts and achieved the following: 
• Reduced re-trafficking of survivors to less than 1% . 
• Successfully garnered the attention and interest of the top government departments and administrators, specifically the Chief Secretary of the Government of Bihar, to address the challenges 
associated with rehabilitation of rescued child labourers and to reduce the incidence of child labour in Bihar.  
• Transformed child protection and  child labour from being solely the concern of Social Welfare or Labour Resource Departments into  a shared responsibility among various entities and 
departments including PRIs, Education Department, Home Department, Jeevika/ Bihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society (BRLP) and others through our persistent outreach. 
• Connected vulnerable families with the PM-JAY scheme (health insurance), surpassing our target by more than 100%, ensuring that families are protected from health-related hazards and do not 
fall into a debt trap. 
• Activated essential social protection mechanisms and extended their reach to 90 % of the most vulnerable households and communities. 
• Closely collaborated with the Bihar Child Labour Commission, enhancing the impact of our efforts. 
 
Executive Summary 
Our current strategy will primarily focus on prevention approaches; and derives from the  critical learnings and achievements of the Child Labour Free Jaipur programme and our subsequent efforts 
in Bihar. Therefore, our holistic programme model addresses not only child labour but also other critical issues affecting the wellbeing of the vulnerable children and their families in Bihar. It aims 
to systematically identify, reach, and empower most vulnerable communities in Bihar to protect their children from various vi olations of child rights. Given the concerning indicators regarding 
child protection in Bihar, our initiative seeks to address the root causes of these violations.  
During the gating period, the project will consolidate learnings so far to pilot a holistic model which will implement three critical interventions in the same community: 
1. Build economic resilience of vulnerable families through access to social security and livelihoods: By prioritising vulnerable families’ access to social security schemes covering health, livelihoods, 
education, we can address their basic needs. This will be done with support from District Child Protection Units (DCPUs) and Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). We will also link vulnerable families 
to alternative livelihoods options t o increase household income. Once the bare minimum is solved for, providing access to alternative livelihoods will help famil ies build positive aspirations, 
complement their incomes, and minimise the risk of them turning to detrimental practices like child  labour, child marriage, and child trafficking 
2. Using schools as safety nets and safe spaces: Safe and thriving learning environments indirectly mitigate risks of children falling into child labour, child marriage, and unsafe migration. The project 
will undertake interventions to identify out of school children and ensure re-enrolment. All vulnerable children under the age of 14 will be supported to continue in school.  
3. Strengthening community and governance institutions for structural, local, and timely response to child protection issues. This will include a systematic mapping and identification of all vulnerable 
children in the intervention districts, which will form the basis of tracking programme impact, success, and learnings.  
 
The project is built on evidence from our past work and stakeholder engagement at the local level.  On one hand, this ensures  that our programme is informed by real time insights into the 
impact of our work, while on the other,  we are able to closely collaborate with the government to integrate best practices and scale up initiatives implemented by ou r partners in pilot villages. 
Through effective stakeholder engagement, we seek to institutionalise successful interventions and am plify their impact.  
In addition, our programm e aims to integrate awareness campaigns and behaviour change initiatives aimed at addressing critical child protection challeng es. By raising awareness and shifting 
mindsets within communities, we will equip both adults and children with the knowledge and t ools to protect themselves and promote their well-being. 
 
Implementation partners 
The initiatives on the ground with communities, Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and the block administration will be imple mented by credible organisations like Center Direct, Aditi, Bhusra Mahila 
Vikas Samiti (BMVS), Tatvasi Samaj Nyas (TSN), and Samagra Sikchhan Evam Vikas Sansthan (SSEVS). These organisations are known for their strong relationships with government departments as 
well as grassroot communities, and will collaborate with key stakeholders across various blocks, districts, and divisions wit hin the state. 
We will also work with technical partners such as Educate Girls, Jan Sahas, or  Pratham, having a track record of effective implementation of sub -strategies relevant to the ToC for COF. They will 
provide technical support to BAT’s implementing partners on programme monitoring, evaluation, progress measurement and docume ntation of data. They will also help to ensure standardization of 
program approaches and enhance program quality amongst all the implementation partners.  
 
The British Asian Trust will analyse, consolidate, and manage the knowledge and best practices shared by all partners. As per the programme MIS, we will house all reports and relevant data, and build 
a repository of knowledge for use across the board. This will help provide an evidence base for cross learning, collaboration, and scale.

F) Survivor Federations: 
Bihar has an existing survivor group of 1215 survivors across 20 districts, partners will work towards creating a federation of survivors by building their capacities.  
• Bring together survivors who have been successfully reintegrated with the families and society to serve as champions of chang e in their communities. 
• Provide peer support to survivors who are still in the rehabilitation process and providing a platform for them to connect, s upport each other, and provide mentorship during their recovery and 
reintegration process. 
• Enhance the capabilities of survivors to effectively engage with government entities, empowering them to participate meaningf ully in relevant decision-making processes. 
 
Scale-up plan  
In Bihar, we have strategically selected one district each from four divisions. The work in each district will be developed as a pilot intervention. Based on the learnings from these pilots, partners 
will work to implement changes at the division level in collaboration with government  and stakeholders from the child protection system. This will help scale impact across the divisions.  
 
The programme structure is designed to make this a success. The BAT State lead along with a partner NGO will be responsible for engaging with the government’s child protection system to build 
the capacity of all relevant duty bearers at the division/ district and state  level. Additionally, the programme will take into account:  
 
• Community ownership: Community based work ensures that the interventions are owned by the community, and the shift only deepens once the project has ended. We will work with family and 
community members to realise positive shifts in knowledge, attitudes, and practice, and drive knowledge and behaviour change within communities. 
 
• Engagement with the government: 
o Engaging with relevant officials (such as the Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development and Panchayat Raj department ) as well as District Magistrates right from inception of the 
programme to improve the quality of care provided by the Child Protection system. This will also help provide access to the most deserving families to social protection schemes implemented 
through the PRI System. 
o Conducting state-level stakeholder mapping exercises with all partners, and building stakeholder and policy engagement plans to include identify the key policy gaps and actors  
o Where possible, we will formalise these arrangements through Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to ensure continuity of the collaborative action regardless of changes in bureaucratic 
or political incumbents. 
 
Example: PMJAY Implementation: In the previous years, partners made significant strides in the implementation of PMJAY (Pradhan  Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana) in Bihar. The impact of this 
initiative was meticulously documented and submitted to the state health department. Activities like organising mega camps gained recognition and were subsequently scaled up across the 
state. 
 
• Building Capacity of Government Institutions:  Along with active engagement with the government we will work to strengthen capacities of key government institutions on the knowledge, 
norms, resource, and implementation gaps in the system to make the collaboration work. To strengthen the institutional capacity of the government system, our approach entails comprehensive 
engagement across multiple levels. This involves con ducting thorough needs assessments to identify capacity gaps and designing tailored training programs to address them. Additi onally, we 
collaborate closely with government stakeholders to develop and implement Standardised Operating Procedures (SOPs), ensuring consistency and efficiency in processes. By integrating relevant 
trainings, SOP development, and collaborative efforts into our approach, we aim to empower government institutions with the tools and resources necessary to address complex social challenges 
effectively and sustainably. 
• Gather evidence for scaling up: To scale to 25% of all villages in the selected blocks under targeted districts, and institutionalise best practices at district and state level, we will: 
o Identify and demonstrate certain processes that can scale impact. e.g., creating standardised modules for formation and training of CPCs and enabling safe school standards. 
o Capture and document key success factors for relevant government bodies to adopt them as seamlessly as possible. 
o Conduct an end-line evaluation to consolidate learnings and evidence for replication and scale up. The findings will be shared with the government and will enable us to scale up the programme 
in each of the selected states. 
Example: Partners are collecting data related to child labour tracking systems in collaboration with Child Welfare Committees (CWC) at the district level. The collected data from the Child Labour 
Tracking System (CLTS) at the district level is then used to analyse trends across the state concerning the release of victim compensation. This data is presented at state-level meetings with 
policymakers, including the Chief Secretary, who reviews the consolidated information and conducts discussions with District Magistrates. This process has led to a directive to streamline victim 
compensation through the Chief Minister's Relief Fund. 
 
• Understand cost and budget implications: Throughout our work, we will build out cost models of what it would take for the government system  or other philanthropies/ NGOs to adopt and 
expand our initiatives. This will ensure we are not using efforts that are too costly and could be implemented by the system going forward. This will ensure smoother adoption of the programme 
model within the system.  
 
MEL approach 
(Also refer to MEL plan from IM annexes file) 
The implementing partners will conduct a vulnerability mapping exercise in each of the target villages, this will help  to map and identify all children in the villages; identifying at risk families and 
children and their participation in school education.  This will also help us in understanding the current situation and getting a baseline and setting clear targets for all implem enting partners. 
The implementing partners will have dedicated Monitoring Evaluation & Learning Coordinators who will work in the project. They will report on pre- approved formats to the BAT MEL personnel 
housed in the project management unit (PMU, BAT) of the state. The reporting to the project monitoring unit by the implementing partners will be quarterly. Monthly reports will be asked by 
the PMU for better oversight purposes. For cases of survivors/ children in need of child protection (CNCP), the implementing partners will maintain data of plan of action and the current status 
along with data on each referral/reporting and outcome of the action. Summary of these will be submitted to the PMU on a mont hly basis. The PMU at the state level, along with technical 
partner in some cases, will undertake field visits, quality checks, audits or other exercises to ensure data quality of the reported dat a. 
 
BAT will onboard a specialised MEL partner to create standard protocols (SOP) and guidelines for all partners in the Monitori ng system for COF/ Kawach  programme. It will help in developing 
robust systems for data collection, tracking, and necessary course corrections, performing quality checks and recommend a detailed quality assurance plan going forward in the programme cycle, 
to ensure the work is standardised and uniformly applied across the  partners. An MIS will be developed that will track each child who has been reported or identified as victim/survivor or 
potential victim of child marriage/ child labour/ child trafficking and child sexual abuse and track this child through out the process of reintegration, the MIS will also automate the reporting and 
visualisation of the state programme and will have automated reports for block, partner, and state level. 
 
Phasing out strategy and sustainability plan 
The one-year plan outlined here serves as the foundational framework for a comprehensive initiative that will span the next decade based on the successes and learnings acquired. This initiative 
is built on a systems-change approach, which means it focuses on creating lasting and sustainable change within the government’s system while simultaneously empowering communities , 
including survivors with particular challenges or issues. The overarching goal is to foster accountability among those respon sible for fulfilling their duties. 
Over the course of the next seven years, this proposed programme will strategically work towards fostering sustainable changes through social and economic transformations within the targeted 
communities and working with the government to build capacity in the child protection workforce as well as other allied departments. This will include better implementation of the existing 
policies such as Mission Vatslaya at various administrative levels, ranging from villages to blocks, districts, and state. Key stakeholders in this process will include ward and district administrations, 
District Child Protection Units (DCPUs), local child protection committees, SMCs and  the school education department. 
A central element of this initiative is to motivate the gram panchayats (local self -governance bodies in rural India) to give greater priority and earmark budgetary  resources specifically on child 
protection endeavours. This allocation of funds empowers communities to independently plan and implement the activities, reduce their dependency on external donors. By emphasising local 
budget allocation for child protection efforts, this initiative fosters community self -reliance, empowering them to take ownership of their development initiatives and reducing external 
dependency. 
 
Sustainability: The progress characterises the ability of the community to own and take actions towards prevention from exploitation and vulnerability. British Asian Trust along with Praxis has 
developed certain tools like community maturity tool to empower the community groups by developing systems and process of collective learning within them. The tool helps to asses s, plan 
and monitor their progress from low maturity to high maturity. 
 
Role of the implementing Partner/s (NGOs) 
Bushra Mahila Vikas Samithy in Darbhanga, Aditi in Sitamarhi, Tatvasi Samaj Nyas in Katihar, and Center Direct in Gaya  have been selected as the main implementing organisations  in 
intervention districts. These districts have been strategically chosen across four divisional commissionerate. The partners will implement  the comprehensive model in 70 villages within these 
districts. The success of these pilot projects will then be demonstrated at th e divisional commissionerate level, and the partners will collaborate with local authorities to ensure the 
implementation of proven models and best practices across all districts wi thin each division. 
These four partners will operate at the grassroots level, providing support to vulnerable families through various initiative s, including livelihood programs, educational activities, monitoring  
systems, awareness campaigns, and capacity -building. Additionally, they will work in collaboration with local groups and structures such as Child Protection Committees (CPCs), School 
Management Committees (SMCs), Self-Help Groups (SHGs), and others. 
 
Role of technical partner 
 
Education: An education partner like Pratham/ Educate Girls will act as a credible knowledge partner, and help assess gaps in the programme regarding: 
• Re-enrolment of children to age-appropriate classes and back into school 
• Management of the remedial coaching centres and support to the community volunteers 
• Interventions and strategies to prevent dropouts from school by improving the scholastic performances of children, and the teaching- learning process inschools. 
• Strategies to improve school safety and engagement with SMCs 
• Effective interventions to activate and ensure sustainable functionality of SMCs 
• Develop and implement the “capacity building plan” for the implementing partners in the areas mentioned above 
• Streamline and standardise processes for education as a preventative means for addressing child protection. 
 
Livelihood: 
We will bring in a technical partner such as America India Foundation (AIF) or Pradan  to conduct a study on most viable trades of rural livelihoods, feasibility of  the trades and consequently 
provide technical support to the implementing partners to experiment and implement livelihoods programme on the ground in selected blocks/ districts. The scoping study of livelihoods practices 
aligned towards improving the economic conditions of families of the vulnerable children will be done by the Technical Agency. The work on livelihoods would help in doubling the incomes, asset 
building or other standards of the economically weaker families to ensure the livelihood programmes as effective.  
 
We will also work with SSEVS who has demonstrated significant impact through its livelihoods work with marginalised communities.  They have assisted survivors and their families in acquiring 
essential skills, supported them in establishing small businesses, and notably established bike garages, vegetable markets, small vegetable farms, and livestock rearing initiatives  for survivors. 
Building on their successes, SSEVS will extend support to all implementing organisations across the state, working towards the goal of economic resilience through alternative livelihoods for 
families. SSEVS will serve as a technical expert agency for livelihood-related matters. 
 
Expertise of SSEVS: SSEVS has successfully organised 2303 farmers into 143 farmers interest groups (FIGs). These farmers, equipped with a comprehensive package of practices, technical inputs, 
and market linkages, are now cultivating pulses, securing fair prices for their produce. SSEVS has also played a pivotal role in empowering 212 Dalit families, nearly doubling their income through 
vegetable cultivation, subsequently improving their nutritional intake. Notably, the org anisation's efforts extend beyond individual farmers to the establishment of two farmers producers’ 
companies. SSEVS actively promotes kitchen gardens, benefiting 200 families/farmers and enhancing their nutritional well-being. Recognizing the gender dimension, SSEVS has introduced small 
agricultural tools, reducing the labour burden on 500 women farmers.  
Conservation practices, such as the adoption of the zero-tillage technique and river basin farming, contribute to resource efficiency and ecosystem 
preservation. Furthermore, 37 landless farmers have embraced sustainable practices by establishing vermi-compost pits, producing organic vermi compost for field use and sale. SSEVS's holistic 
approach addresses livelihoods, nutrition, gender inclusivity, and environmental sustainability in the agricultural sector. 
 
System Strengthening: Over the past year, due to Center Direct's engagement with the system, we have witnessed significant impact , such as meetings with the Chief Secretary to discuss victim 
compensation schemes and other convergence actions for child labour. State Child Prote ction Societies (SCPs) have issued orders for the formation of Child Protection Committees (CPCs), not 
just for Center Direct but for all partners in the network  in Bihar. Additionally, mega social security camps have been conducted through DLSA. Suresh Kumar, the Executive Director of Center 
Direct, has  gained significant importance among all stakeholders. He has been invited to conduct capacity building on child rights issues for stakeholders such as police and legal entities. 
Stakeholders also reach out to Center Direct for guidance in handling challenging cases .

KAWACH  MEL  -  Quality  Assurance  Report  
November-December  2024  
In  November  2024,  the  CMS  team  conducted  ﬁeld  visits  to  two  partner  organisations  each  in  
West
 
Bengal,
 
and
 
Bihar,
 
one
 
in
 
Uttar
 
Pradesh
 
and
 
four
 
partners
 
in
 
Rajasthan
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
second
 
QA
 
visit
 
after
 
the
 
implementation
 
of
 
the
 
MIS
 
tool.
 
The
 
objective
 
of
 
these
 
visits
 
was
 
similar
 
to
 
the
 
1st
 
QA
 
visit
 
and
 
implement
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
Quality
 
Assurance
 
(QA)
 
mechanism
 
aimed
 
at
 
enhancing
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
activity
 
MIS
 
tool
 
and
 
ensuring
 
data
 
integrity
 
across
 
the
 
Kawach
 
programme.
 
The  QA  visits  were  designed  to  achieve  several  key  objectives:  
1.  Ensure  Data  Accuracy  and  Reliability :  We  aimed  to  validate  the  data  entered  into  the  
MIS,
 
conﬁrming
 
its
 
correctness
 
and
 
consistency
 
with
 
actual
 
ﬁeld
 
observations
 
through
 
checks
 
against
 
physical
 
records
 
maintained
 
by
 
the
 
partners.
 2.  Assess  MIS  Implementation  Quality :  Our  team  evaluated  the  implementation  of  the  
MIS
 
to
 
ensure
 
it
 
aligns
 
with
 
design
 
speciﬁcations,
 
identifying
 
any
 
deviations
 
that
 
may
 
affect
 
data
 
quality
 
and
 
reporting.
 3.  Gather  Partner  Feedback :  Engaging  directly  with  partners  allowed  us  to  gain  insights  
into
 
their
 
experiences
 
with
 
the
 
MIS,
 
focusing
 
on
 
usability,
 
relevance,
 
and
 
any
 
challenges
 
they
 
faced
 
in
 
its
 
implementation.
 4.  Enable  Continuous  Improvement :  Insights  from  the  ﬁeld  observations  and  partner  
feedback
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
reﬁne
 
the
 
QA
 
mechanism
 
and
 
enhance
 
the
 
MIS,
 
ultimately
 
improving
 
data
 
quality
 
and
 
partner
 
engagement.
 
During  the  visits,  the  QA  team  undertook  speciﬁc  actions  like  random  checks  of  data  and  
evidence
 
submitted
 
through
 
the
 
Activity
 
MIS
 
tool
 
with
 
actual
 
physical
 
records
 
of
 
the
 
same
 
maintained
 
by
 
the
 
organisation,
 
engaging
 
with
 
groups
 
and
 
collectives
 
and
 
verifying
 
details
 
of
 
their
 
recent
 
meeting
 
through
 
recall
 
and
 
ﬁnally
 
engaged
 
in
 
structured
 
observations
 
to
 
validate
 
data
 
integrity,
 
assess
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
MIS
 
processes,
 
and
 
gather
 
valuable
 
partner
 
insights.
 
 
The  following  actions  are  emerging  from  the  QA  visits:  
1.  Developing  common  understanding  of  the  program  strategy   a.  Operational/functional  criteria  for  CPCs  and  SMCs  b.  Understanding  of  how  social  protection  data  has  to  be  captured  c.  Development  of  a  concise  two-page  note  with  clear  examples  to  provide  
improve
 
understanding
 
on
 
categorising
 
activities
 
as
 
multi-stakeholder
 
or
 
single-stakeholder
 2.  Deﬁning  SoPs  for  collection  of  means  of  veriﬁcation  3.  Conducting  online  refresher  training  for  revised  sections  and  utilisation  of  dashboards  4.  Updating  the  data  range  limits  put  in  the  tool  to  smoothen  the  process  5.  Sending  the  Manuals  and  Flowcharts  of  all  sections  for  clear  understanding  of  what  
each
 
section
 
covers
 6.  Walkthrough  of  the  dashboards  for  all  partners

   All  partners  and  their  teams  were  in  the  initial  phase  of  the  implementation  and  getting  used  to  
it
 
slowly
 
by
 
transitioning
 
to
 
this
 
new
 
system.
 
While
 
a
 
few
 
of
 
the
 
partners
 
are
 
mature
 
with
 
data
 
systems
 
and
 
very
 
comfortable
 
with
 
it,
 
some
 
of
 
them
 
will
 
require
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
handholding.
 
We
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
provide
 
necessary
 
support
 
to
 
ensure
 
the
 
uptake
 
and
 
compliance
 
for
 
the
 
data
 
quality
 
and
 
regular
 
reporting.

West  Bengal  CRY  ●  CRY  had  144  submissions,  with  most  data  from  households,  child  collectives,  CPCs,  and  parent  collectives,  but  evidence  like  meeting  minutes  and  attendance  signature  was  missing.  Only  35  cases  were  registered  on  the  MIS  tool  despite  signiﬁcant  ground  activity.  ●  MIS  tool  usage  is  inconsistent,  with  only  six  out  of  13+  animators  making  entries.  The  team  lacks  familiarity  with  the  tool,  views  it  as  an  additional  workload,  and  struggles  with  basic  functionalities  due  to  insufﬁcient  practice  and  training.  ●  There  is  no  routine  for  data  entry,  and  the  organisation  has  not  prioritised  integrating  the  MIS  tool  into  daily  operations.

household  schemes,  with  signiﬁcant  errors  in  sub-activity  selection.  Meeting  minutes  were  uploaded  for  a  few  sessions  but  could  not  be  veriﬁed  due  to  the  absence  of  physical  records.  ●  The  team  displayed  minimal  engagement  with  the  MIS  tool;  one  CM  was  unaware  of  the  system,  while  others  had  uninstalled  the  app.  A  comprehensive  orientation  was  conducted,  but  sustained  handholding  and  feedback  are  necessary  for  familiarity  and  conﬁdence.  ●  The  organisation  lacks  proper  protocols  and  formats  for  documenting  activities,  with  ﬁeld  work  largely  unsupervised.  The  team  is  spread  across  two  districts,  creating  further  operational  challenges.  
Uttar  Pradesh  ROSA  ●  ROSA  had  164  submissions  in  the  MIS  tool,  but  only  two  CPC  and  no  SMC  monthly  meetings  were  recorded.  Many  submissions  lacked  meeting  minutes  or  attendance  registers,  and  errors  in  classifying  activities  caused  data  issues.  ●  Community  mobilisers  found  the  tool  difﬁcult  to  use,  struggling  with  features  like  auto-sync  and  categorising  activities.  A  training  session  helped  address  some  problems,  but  more  regular  training  and  dashboard-focused  sessions  are  needed.  ●  Limited  support  from  senior  staff  and  the  extra  workload  of  internal  reporting  made  it  hard  for  the  team  to  use  the  MIS  tool  effectively.

Bihar  BMVS  ●  BMVS  submitted  229  entries  till  then,  with  most  activities  focused  on  CPCs  and  youth  collectives.  While  the  data  was  consistent  with  physical  records,  entries  lacked  detailed  evidence,  such  as  meeting  minutes,  and  follow-ups  for  registered  cases  were  not  entered.  ●  The  team  struggled  with  MIS  tool  features  and  proper  classiﬁcation  of  activities,  with  errors  such  as  miscategorising  SMC  meetings  and  social  protection  work.  A  training  session  helped  clarify  these  gaps,  but  more  practice  and  guidance  are  required,  particularly  for  new  features.  ●  Organisational  challenges,  including  the  Programme  Coordinator's  limited  technical  proﬁciency  and  the  team’s  heavy  workload,  have  hindered  the  effective  use  of  the  dashboard  and  MIS  tool.

A  training  session  helped,  but  they  still  need  more  support.The  program  coordinator  is  actively  supporting  the  use  of  the  dashboard  and  MIS  tool.  ●  The  team  has  a  heavy  workload,  with  each  mobiliser  responsible  for  visiting  ﬁve  villages  and  managing  many  meetings,  causing  delays  in  data  entry.  Problems  with  the  tool  were  not  properly  discussed  in  team  meetings,  so  they  resolved  issues  informally.   However,  the  program  coordinator  is  actively  supporting  the  use  of  the  dashboard  and  MIS  tool.  
Rajasthan  LEDS  ●  LEDS  made  59  entries  in  November,  mostly  focused  on  child/youth  collectives,  parent  collectives,  and  households.  Some  data,  like  work  on  social  protection  and  LRC  enrolments,  was  entered  in  the  wrong  sections.  ●  The  team  was  comfortable  using  the  tool  but  had  trouble  understanding  some  sections  and  uploading  the  right  documents  as  evidence.  A  reorientation  session  helped  ﬁx  these  issues  and  explained  where  to  enter  speciﬁc  activities.  ●  Only  one  of  the  three  team  members  using  the  tool  had  attended  training,  but  she  helped  the  others  learn.  The  Program  Coordinator  was  also  trained  to  use  the  dashboard  for  better  tracking.

SEWA  ●  The  SEWA  team  showed  a  great  improvement  in  using  the  application  in  the  2nd  QA  visit  as  compared  to  the  ﬁrst.  Results  from  tool  reorientation  provided  during  the  1st  QA  visit  were  clearly  evident  in  the  2nd  visit,  with  all  the  members  being  quite  at  ease  with  navigating  through  the  sections  effectively.   ●  Queries  arose  particularly  due  to  the  lack  of  alignment  between  SEWA’s  work  on  ground  (with  SHGs  and  women)  and  the  tool  structure.  Restructuring  and  reﬁning  the  questions  in  the  tool  could  potentially  enable  the  team  to  enter  their  work  in  the  relevant  sections  quickly  and  effectively,  thus  avoiding  any  confusion  on  it.

 Theme  Narrative  
Veriﬁcation  of  current  tool  implementation  
Review  of  data  entries:  Till  our  visit,  there  were  only  144  submissions  from  CRY.  Most  activities  are  being  done  in  households,  child  collectives,  CPCs  and  parent  collectives. Submissions  from  the  month  of  November  were  reviewed  and  out  of  13+   animators,  only  6  had  made  entries  on  the  activity  MIS  tool. In  them,  only  pictures  were  submitted  as  means  of  veriﬁcation,  so  we  could  verify  the  number  of  attendees  from  the  data  entries  on  MIS  which  largely  matched. There  have  been  a  lot  of  cases  being  identiﬁed  on  ground,  but  only  35  of  them  were  registered  on  the  MIS  tool.  There  seems  to  be  a  lack  of  clarity  on  what  evidence  needs  to  be  uploaded  since  there  were  no  meeting  minutes  or  attendance  register  uploaded  on  the  tool.    Observing  data  entry  process  and  assessing  MIS  protocols:  Usage  of  the  MIS  tool  is  not  integrated  into  CRY’s  daily  operations.   While  the  project  coordinator  claims  to  have  instructed  the  team  to  complete  data  entry  by  the  end  of  each  day,  the  ﬁeld  team  members  have  expressed  challenges  in  meeting  this  expectation.  There  is  no  established  routine  for  data  entry  in  CRY.  While  MIS  protocols  like  pre-deﬁned  ranges  are  mostly  being  adhered  to,  qualitative  remarks  can  be  used  better.  The  tool  is  still  quite  unfamiliar  to  them  since  there  has  not  been  much  usage  and  discussion  around  it  in  the  organisation.    Repeated  errors  and  common  challenges:  ●  Frequent  selection  of  “NO”  in  the  question  -  is  there  an  active  child  collective  in  the  village  when  they  are  ﬁlling  monthly  meeting  details.   ●  No  attendance  register  or  meeting  minutes  being  uploaded.

   Understanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  
User  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  Community  mobilisers,  MIS  coordinators  and  the  Program  coordinator  -  all  were  hesitant  while  navigating  the  application.  The  main  gap  that  was  observed  was  the  members  could  not  see  any  value  addition  of  this  tool  into  their  daily  operation.  There  is  a  grave  need  for  a  session  where  examples  are  given  regarding  how  this  tool  could  be  integrated  into  their  program.  Their  lack  of  engagement  has  limited  their  ability  to  assess  its  full  potential  or  beneﬁts,  leaving  their  feedback  primarily  hypothetical  or  based  on  assumptions.  A  few  team  members  were  unfamiliar  with  the  full  range  of  features  the  MIS  tool  offers.  Due  to  insufﬁcient  practice,  some  members  have  forgotten  key  functionalities.  One  team  member  encountered  a  technical  issue  during  the  installation  process  and  was  unable  to  correctly  install  the  MIS  app,  which  further  impeded  their  ability  to  engage  with  and  learn  the  tool.  These  gaps  in  familiarity  and  training  suggest  the  need  for  targeted  interventions,  such  as  hands-on  training  sessions,  ongoing  technical  support,  and  regular  reinforcement  of  the  tool's  relevance  to  their  work.  
Feedback  on  MIS  utility:  The  team  perceives  the  MIS  tool  as  an  additional  workload  that  requires  extra  time,  which  has  contributed  to  its  underutilization. This  indicates  a  lack  of  awareness  and  understanding  of  the  tool's  functionality  and  potential  beneﬁts.  The  team  does  not  see  a  clear  connection  between  the  MIS  tool  and  their  daily  work,  which  further  diminishes  its  perceived  value.   
Future  needs  and  recommendations:  CRY  team  recommended  a  feature  to  view  their  daily  history  of  data  entries,  so  that  they  can  keep  track  of  their  submissions.   
On-Ground  Feedback  Collection  
Identiﬁcation  of  New  Challenges:  MIS  data  entry  is  not  a  priority  for  either  the  ﬁeld  team  or  the  organisation.  There  appears  to  be  no  dedicated  effort  to  promote  or  enforce  data  entry  at  the  organisational  level.   They  report  that  their  work  often  extends  into  the  late  evening,  leaving  them  insufﬁcient  time  to  complete  the  task.  Despite  these  concerns  being  raised,  the  organisation  has  not  addressed  the  issues  or  implemented  measures  to  resolve  them.   
Partner-Speciﬁc  QA  Process  Review:  With  a  large  team  of  experienced  animators,  CRY  has  established  signiﬁcant  reach  and  rapport  within  the  community,  as  evidenced  by  interactions  with  CPC  members.  The  CPC  register  is  well-maintained,  containing  attendance  lists,  signatures,  and  detailed  meeting  minutes  of  good  quality. Attendance  records  for  the  year  showed  that  80%  of  CPC  members  regularly  participated  in  meetings,  reﬂecting  strong  engagement.  While  substantial  work  is  being  carried  out  on  the  ground  with  
Catalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       13
   proper  documentation  and  evidence  collection,  much  of  this  is  not  entered  into  the  MIS  tool.  Field  team  members  seldom  use  the  MIS  tool,  and  data  that  is  entered  is  not  systematically  veriﬁed  by  the  organisation.  When  asked  about  their  veriﬁcation  process,  it  was  observed  that  all  data  is  maintained  manually. The  team  organises  activity-wise  information  systematically,  relying  on  ﬁeld  diaries  to  record  meeting  minutes  and  other  details. This  manual  system  ensures  data  is  captured  at  the  ﬁeld  level,  but  the  organisation  lacks  a  dedicated  person  to  verify  MIS  entries.  Moreover,  the  team  maintains  daily  diaries  to  document  activities  and  shares  updates  with  the  Project  Coordinator  via  WhatsApp.  These  updates  include  a  narrative  of  the  day’s  events,  supported  by  photographs.

Veriﬁcation  of  current  tool  implementation  
Review  of  data  entries:  BSA  had  the  lowest  number  of  entries,  with  only  29  recorded  up  to  the  time  of  our  visit.  The  last  entry  was  made  in  the  ﬁnal  week  of  September,  primarily  covering  child  collectives,  parent  collectives,  and  household  schemes.  Several  errors  were  observed  in  selecting  incorrect  sub-activities.  For  a  few  meetings,  minutes  were  uploaded  along  with  the  total  number  of  attendees,  but  these  minutes  could  not  be  veriﬁed  due  to  the  absence  of  physical  records  at  the  organisational  level.  12  unique  child  cases  were  registered  by  two  CMs,  but  no  follow  ups  had  been  conducted.  The  team  struggled  to  address  our  queries  about  the  MIS  data,  as  the  entries  were  made  over  two  months  ago.     Observing  data  entry  process  and  assessing  MIS  protocols:  BSA  has  a  team  of  ﬁve  community  mobilisers,  one  of  whom  joined  after  CMS’s  capacity-building  workshop  and  was  therefore  unaware  of  the  systems  in  place.  The  other  CMs  had  uninstalled  the  SurveyCTO  app  from  their  phones,  reﬂecting  limited  engagement  with  the  tool.  When  asked  to  enter  dummy  data,  the  team’s  unfamiliarity  with  the  tool  was  evident,  as  it  felt  nearly  new  to  them.   Repeated  errors  and  common  challenges:  Since  the  community  mobilisers  are  not  actively  entering  data  or  using  the  MIS  tool,  they  did  not  have  many  queries  regarding  it.

   Understanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  
User  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  During  the  visit,  a  comprehensive  orientation  session  on  the  MIS  tool  was  conducted  at  the  ofﬁce.  While  this  session  provided  a  good  starting  point,  the  team  will  require  sustained  handholding  support  over  an  extended  period,  coupled  with  regular  feedback,  to  build  familiarity  and  conﬁdence  in  using  the  tool.   Feedback  on  MIS  utility:  Due  to  their  limited  use  of  the  MIS  tool,  the  team  found  it  challenging  to  provide  detailed  feedback  or  share  their  opinions  on  its  utility.  However,  the  organisation’s  head  was  highly  impressed  by  the  tool  and  the  capabilities  of  the  dashboard.  They  expressed  a  strong  intention  to  integrate  the  dashboard  into  their  operations,  recognising  its  potential  as  a  valuable  decision  making  tool.   Future  needs  and  recommendations:  A  recurring  theme  in  conversations  with  the  team  was  the  lack  of  effective  communication.  So  a  huge  need  to  ensure  CMS’s  communication  reaches  them  reliably.   
On-Ground  Feedback  Collection  
Identiﬁcation  of  New  Challenges:  BSA  is  still  at  an  early  stage  in  setting  up  their  program  and  reach  in  a  new  operational  area  with  considerable  organisational  challenges.  The  previous  Program  Coordinator  and  our  major  point  of  contact  is  no  longer  looking  into  the  KAWACH  project.  The  team  is  also  spread  across  two  districts,  with  all  the  community  mobilisers  in  one  district  while  the  MIS  person  and  the  organisation’s  head  in  the  other  district.  Along  with  that,  there  are  no  proper  protocols  or  formats  being  maintained  on  the  work  that  is  being  done  on  the  ground.  The  daily  work  is  also  not  being  documented  or  reported.  So  the  ﬁeld  team  along  with  the  numbers  they  report  at  the  end  of  the  month  is  largely  being  unsupervised.    Partner-Speciﬁc  QA  Process  Review:  BSA  is  at  an  early  stage  of  forming  child  collectives,  parent  collectives,  and  CPCs.  Some  meetings  and  mobilisation  sessions  are  done  along  with  linking  community  to  required  documents  and  schemes.  Some  dropout  cases  are  also  coming  out.  However,  there  is  no  proper  documentation  of  these  activities.  The  veriﬁcation  process  is  absent  within  the  organisation  due  to  lack  of  protocols  and  organisational  challenges.

Veriﬁcation  of  current  tool  implementation  
Review  of  Data  Entries:  During  the  second  Quality  Assurance  visit,  the  CMS  team  reviewed  submissions  from  the  last  30  days  in  the  Activity  MIS  tool.  ROSA  had  recorded  approximately  164  submissions  by  the  time  of  the  visit.  However,  several  inconsistencies  and  incorrect  entries  were  identiﬁed. Only  two  submissions  were  related  to  CPC  monthly  meetings,  and  none  were  recorded  for  SMC  monthly  meetings.  Many  entries  for  awareness  sessions  with  child  collectives  included  all  the  options  for  preparation,  mobilisation,  and  conduct  of  sessions,  with  similar  data  repeated  across  these  ﬁelds. Submissions  primarily  included  photographs,  with  only  a  few  including  meeting  minutes  or  attendance  registers.  Veriﬁcation  of  these  minutes  and  attendance  records  was  not  possible  due  to  their  unavailability  at  the  organisational  level.  However,  CMS  was  able  to  review  a  register  at  one  of  the  CPCs  and  provided  recommendations  on  improving  documentation  practices,  as  the  recorded  meeting  minutes  required  enhancement.  
Observing  Data  Entry  Processes  and  Assessing  MIS  Protocols:  ROSA  is  still  integrating  the  Activity  MIS  tool  into  their  daily  operations.  During  the  ﬁeld  visit,  CMS  observed  two  group  meetings—one  with  the  SMC  and  another  with  the  CPC.  Community  mobilisers  faced  challenges  entering  information  about  these  meetings  into  the  MIS  tool,  particularly  when  deciding  whether  to  classify  them  as  multi-stakeholder  engagements  or  speciﬁc  stakeholder  meetings.  They  explained  that  SMCs  and  CPCs  often  involve  multiple  stakeholders,  such  as  school  teachers,  the  Sarpanch,  ANM,  and  parents.  This  misclassiﬁcation,  also  supported  by  the  Block  Technical  Person,  MIS  personnel,  and  Program  Coordinator,  resulted  in  inaccurate  SMC  and  CPC  meeting  numbers  on  the  dashboard.  This  indicates  a  lack  of  understanding  regarding  the  correct  categorisation  of  activities  in  the  MIS  tool.  Additionally,  the  team  struggled  to  utilise  various  tool  features,  including  the  save  and  edit  functions,  the  refresh  button,  and  auto-syncing.  Despite  these  challenges,  the  qualitative  remarks  in  the  reviewed  submissions  were  insightful  and  provided  a  valuable  understanding  of  the  activities  conducted.  
Repeated  Errors  and  Common  Challenges:  In  addition  to  the  above,  the  ROSA  team  highlighted  the  following  MIS-related  challenges:  
Catalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       16
   
●  Many  forms  were  unintentionally  submitted  when  the  team  thought  they  were  saving  them  for  later,  due  to  the  auto-sync  option  being  enabled.  This  also  prevented  meeting  minutes  from  being  uploaded  promptly,  as  they  were  often  unavailable  immediately  after  sessions.  CMS  resolved  this  issue  by  instructing  the  team  to  disable  the  auto-sync  option  when  saving  forms.  ●  The  team  encountered  difﬁculties  uploading  multi-page  meeting  minutes  as  images.  CMS  recommended  converting  and  uploading  these  documents  as  PDFs  instead.  ●  The  tool  restricted  the  number  of  currently  enrolled  children  in  school  to  50,  which  did  not  align  with  ROSA’s  data  needs. ●  Some  CMs  entered  legacy  case  details,  leading  to  duplicates.  The  Program  Coordinator  said  they  would   provide  a  list  of  these  entries.  ●  Usage  of  “Others”  in  the  tool  ●  Overall  confusion  regarding  entry  of  awareness  sessions  and  monthly  meetings.  
Understanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  
User  Familiarity  and  Training  Gaps:  Conversations  around  the  MIS  tool  revealed  hesitancy  among  the  community  mobilisers,  who  were  unaware  of  many  of  the  discrepancies  identiﬁed  during  the  review.  There  remains  a  lack  of  clarity  about  correctly  categorising  activities  within  the  tool,  particularly  regarding  monthly  meetings  of  institutions  like  CPC  and  SMC,  and  understanding  what  qualiﬁes  as  multi-stakeholder  engagement. They  were  successful  in  registering  child  cases;  however,   mobilisers  were  unfamiliar  with  newer  options  in  the  case  registration  section,  such  as  those  related  to  vulnerability  mapping  and  case  recurrence.  A  small-scale  training  session  was  conducted  during  the  visit  to  address  some  of  these  gaps  and  provide  immediate  guidance.   
Feedback  on  MIS  Utility:  The  ﬁeld  team  found  it  highly  beneﬁcial  for  their  routine  activity  reporting.  Additionally,  the  Program  Coordinator  and  MIS  personnel  deemed  it  effective  for  compiling  numerical  data,  tracking  ﬁeld  staff  activities,  and  generating  reports.   
Future  Needs  and  Recommendations:  ROSA  suggested  that  the  frequent  training  sessions  on  the  MIS  tool  have  been  highly  beneﬁcial  for  their  team.  They  recommended  conducting  these  sessions  more  often,  with  an  added  focus  on  dashboard  demonstrations  to  further  enhance  their   conﬁdence  with  using  the  tool.

Identiﬁcation  of  New  Challenges:  ROSA  has  demonstrated  exceptional  progress  in  establishing  its  programme  and  extending  its  reach  in  a  new  operational

   area  within  a  short  period.  The  organisation  has  also  been  successful  in  building  strong  relationships  at  the  district  level.  The  CPC  and  SMCs  we  interacted  with  were  proactive  and  showed  signs  of  signiﬁcant  strengthening. However,  there  is  room  for  improvement  in  reporting  through  the  Activity  MIS  tool.  The  Project  Coordinator  and  MIS  personnel  were  not  consistently  engaged  in  supporting  the  community  mobilisers  or  monitoring  submissions.  Additionally,  community  mobilisers  are  required  to  complete  two  Google  forms  daily  for  internal  reporting,  which,  combined  with  limited  engagement  from  senior  personnel,  has  impacted  their  ability  to  fully  utilise  the  MIS  tool.  
Furthermore,  community  mobilisers  do  not  interact  with  all  SMCs  in  their  operational  area  each  month.  Instead,  the  SMCs  are  expected  to  operate  independently  and  conduct  monthly  meetings.  As  a  result,  there  are  delays  in  obtaining  meeting  minutes  from  these  SMCs.  Addressing  these  challenges  will  help  ROSA  further  streamline  its  reporting  and  strengthen  its  overall  programme  delivery.  
Partner-Speciﬁc  QA  Process  Review:  ROSA  has  established  a  structured  planning  system  aligned  with  its  annual  plan  for  the  KAWACH  program.  This  is  broken  down  into  quarterly,  monthly,  and  weekly  plans  that  guide  team  activities.  Daily  planning  and  reporting  are  efﬁciently  documented  using  their  internal  google  forms  called  -  Forms  1  and  2.  These  forms  are  submitted  weekly  to  the  Block  Technical  Person  (BTP),  who  compiles  the  information  into  an  Excel  sheet.  This  compiled  report  is  then  forwarded  to  the  Project  Coordinator  (PC)  for  veriﬁcation  before  being  reviewed  and  submitted  to  the  Director  by  the  MIS  team.  While  the  overall  process  demonstrates  a  strong  commitment  to  structured  reporting,  tangible  evidence  of  data  veriﬁcation  by  the  BTP,  MIS,  or  PC  was  not  available  during  the  visit. Verbal  explanations  of  the  process  were  shared,  indicating  an  understanding  of  the  importance  of  veriﬁcation  at  all  levels.  To  further  strengthen  this  process,  implementation  of  a  formalised  data  veriﬁcation  mechanism  was  recommended.  This  step  will  enhance  transparency  and  ensure  consistency  across  all  levels  of  reporting.

   Veriﬁcation  of  current  tool  implementation  
Review  of  Data  Entries:  From  the  review  of  form  submissions  at  the  back-end,  it  was  observed  that  about  229  entries  were  submitted  for  the  month  of  October  with  activities  surrounding  children/youth  collectives,  SMCs/VECs,  CPCs,  community  and  case  management  accounting  for  56,  27,  101,  8  and  44  submissions  respectively.  It  is  evident  that  partner’s  work  with  CPCs  followed  by  youth  collectives  has  been  widely  conducted  and  reported  while  their  work  with  SMCs  and  the  community  is  not  predominantly  conducted  or  reported.  These  submissions  are  mainly  by  2  CMs  who  have  speciﬁcally  been  assigned  the  task  of  data  entry.  The  mobilisers  have  only  uploaded  images  of  the  list  of  attendees  and  of  the  meeting  as  means  of  veriﬁcation.  CMS  cross-veriﬁed  these  data  entries  with  physical  records  at  the  BMVS  ofﬁce,  including  daily  diaries  maintained  by  community  mobilisers  and  block  coordinators.  These  ﬁgures  were  found  to  be  largely  consistent  with  the  data  points.  BMVS  also  provided  compiled  formats  ﬁled  in  their  ofﬁce,  such  as  attendance  records  and  activities  list  to  corroborate  the  CPC  and  youth  collectives  data.   
It  was  observed  that  while  the  data  for  child/youth  collectives  was  entered  correctly,  no  data  was  entered  under  the  parent  collectives  section,  for  enrollments  in  school/at  the  learning  centre  and  for  social  protection  even  while  the  partner  works  on  these  themes.  For  tracking  cases  using  the  case  management  section,  it  was  noticed  that  while  the  enumerators  had  registered  a  lot  of  new  cases,  no  data  was  entered  for  the  follow-up  of  the  cases.  It  was  also  noticed  that  data  on  a  few  sub-sections  such  as  social  protection  and  community  awareness  was  wrongly  entered  in  some  other  sub-section.  It  was  then  clariﬁed  that  the  social  protection  information  should  go  under  the  activities  with  households  sub-section  and  the  work  on  organising  awareness  campaigns  needs  to  be  reported  in  the  multistakeholder  sub-section.     
Observing  Data  Entry  Processes  and  Assessing  MIS  Protocols:  During  the  Quality  Assurance  visit,  two  community-level  meetings  were  observed  in  the  Jale  intervention  area—one  with  the  CPC  and  another  with  the  SMC.  Field  observations  revealed  that  community  mobilisers  and  block  coordinators  document  meeting  agendas  and  key  details  in  their  diaries.  School-level  facilitators  also  maintain  records,  while  photographs  of  activities  are  systematically  taken.  The  CPC  meeting  was  well-organised,  with  strong  liaison  observed  between  the  community  and  the  Pradhan. Similarly,  the  SMC  demonstrated  sincere  efforts  in  carrying  out  their  responsibilities.  However,  when  asked  to  enter  details  of  these  meetings,  gaps  in  understanding  the  MIS  tool  were  evident  across  the  team.  There  was  considerable  confusion  about  classifying  these  meetings  into  multistakeholder  engagements  and  individual  stakeholder  activities. A  brief  training  session  at  the  ofﬁce  provided  clariﬁcation  on  these  issues.  Team  members  were  guided  through  dummy  entries  under  supervision  to  build  their  conﬁdence  and  address  immediate  queries.   
The  team  was  also  unaware  about  the  newer  features  on  the  MIS  tool  like  case  recurrence  or  children  identiﬁed  during  vulnerability  mapping  in  the  case  registration  section.   
Catalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       19
   
 Repeated  Errors  and  Common  Challenges:  
●  There  was  no  data  on  critical  indicators,  such  as  school  enrolments,  parent  collective  learning  centre  participation,  livelihoods  (SP  and  seed  money),  and  case  registrations  that  BMVS  is  working  on  ground  being  reﬂected  on  the  dashboard.  These  gaps  were  attributed  to  the  ﬁeld  team’s  uncertainty  about  where  to  input  such  information  in  the  Activity  MIS  tool.   ●  Additionally,  incorrect  use  of  the  "Multistakeholder"  category  led  to  erroneous  entries,  such  as  labour  ofﬁce  visits  being  classiﬁed  as  convergence  meetings.  A  lot  of  SMC  meetings  were  also  entered  into  multistakeholder  activities  hence  the  dashboard  did  not  reﬂect  the  actual  number  of  monthly  meetings  for  SMC.  ●  There  were  a  few  cases  where  Hindi  translation  was  not  being  understood  properly.  ●  All  social  protection  related  work  and  awareness  activities  were  being  entered  in  the  “Activities  surrounding  the  community”  section.   ●  Recently  identiﬁed  cases  were  not  being  registered,  and  follow-ups  on  previous  cases  were  not  being  recorded.  ●  CMs  are  providing  1  or  2  words  in  the  qualitative  remark  sections.  ●  The  mobilisers  are  only  uploading  images  of  the  list  of  attendees  and  of  the  meeting  as  means  of  veriﬁcation  
Understanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  
User  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  BMVS’s  ﬁeld  team  showed  hesitancy  and  inconsistent  understanding  of  the  activity  MIS  tool.  For  example,  after  the  CPC  meeting,  CMs  and  the  Block  Coordinator  struggled  to  enter  meeting  details  accurately,  often  omitting  agenda  points  and  misclassifying  responses. Questions  on  key  features  like  partial  save,  editing  before  ﬁnal  submission,  and  ﬁle  renaming  highlighted  their  limited  familiarity  with  the  tool.  Only  the  Technical  Person  demonstrated  a  moderate  understanding  of  SurveyCTO,  while  other  staff  showed  minimal  conﬁdence. Although  all  team  members  were  aware  of  the  KAWACH  Activity  MIS  Manual,  the  absence  of  physical  copies  or  accessible  digital  versions  meant  they  had  not  reviewed  it.  Conversations  during  the  CPC  and  SMC  visit  also  brought  out  the  gaps  in  programmatic  understanding  like  deﬁnitions  of  operational  and  functional  criteria.  This  shows  a  clear  need  for  training  the  new  features  and  overall  practice  on  the  partner’s  part.  The  program  coordinator  also  seems  hesitant  with  regard  to  a  technology  like  the  dashboard  and  was  underconﬁdent  in  exploring  the  features.   
Feedback  on  MIS  utility:  The  community  mobilisers  believe  that  the  MIS  tool  will  be  beneﬁcial  once  all  processes  are  streamlined.  They  feel  that  they  will  
Catalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       20
   become  more  comfortable  with  the  tool  with  additional  practice  and  the  establishment  of  a  data  entry  culture  within  the  entire  team.  
Future  needs  and  recommendations:  Given  the  signiﬁcant  confusion  around  categorising  activities  as  multi-stakeholder  or  single-stakeholder,  BMVS  recommended  the  development  of  a  concise  two-page  note  with  clear  examples  to  provide  practical  guidance  and  improve  understanding. This  resource  would  help  ensure  consistency  and  accuracy  in  data  entry.   They  also  requested  assistance  in  identifying  and  resolving  duplicate  or  incorrect  entries.  
On-Ground  Feedback  Collection  
Identiﬁcation  of  New  Challenges:  During  our  interactions,  it  became  apparent  that  BMVS  faces  certain  organisational  challenges.  The  Programme  Coordinator's  limited  technical  proﬁciency  restricts  their  ability  to  effectively  support  the  Community  Mobilisers,  which  in  turn  reduces  the  utility  of  the  dashboard. Additionally,  the  team’s  heavy  workload  further  limits  their  ability  to  fully  leverage  the  MIS  tool,  compounding  the  challenges  in  its  utilisation.  
Partner-Speciﬁc  QA  Process  Review:  BMVS’s  reporting  operates  through  a  structured  framework  involving  multiple  levels.  Daily  updates  are  shared  via  WhatsApp  groups,  where  activity  photos  with  brief  descriptions  are  posted  on  the  same  day. Meeting  records  are  documented  in  physical  registers  or  daily  diaries,  while  monthly  updates  are  consolidated  into  the  partner’s  internal  Excel  sheet  during  ofﬁce  meetings.  Data  is  also  periodically  uploaded  to  the  activity  MIS  tool,  though  not  consistently  on  a  daily  basis.  Despite  this  systematic  approach,  no  concrete  evidence  was  provided  regarding  the  data  veriﬁcation  processes  employed  by  the  Program  Coordinator,  and  technical  personnel.  While  verbal  explanations  indicated  that  the  Program  Coordinator  and  technical  staff  occasionally  accompany  ﬁeld  activities,  no  supporting  documentation  or  records  were  made  available  to  substantiate  these  claims.

   Veriﬁcation  of  current  tool  implementation  
Review  of  Data  Entries:  Meeting  minutes,  attendance  list  of  monthly  meetings  were  veriﬁed  using  CD’s  range  of  physical  records  available  in  their  ofﬁce.  Overall,  about  299  data  entries  were  submitted  during  the  month  of  October  with  the  majority  (109)  being  on  activities  surrounding  CPCs,  67  were  on  activities  surrounding  youth  groups  (mainly  creating  awareness),  while  a  smaller  number  -  36,  21,  15,  17  -  of  submissions  were  for  activities  surrounding  SMCs,  schools,  learning  centres  and  on  organising  awareness  sessions  with  the  community.  A  handful  of  submissions  (10  and  7)  focused  on  activities  surrounding  parent  collectives  and  other  community  groups. On  reviewing  entries  at  the  backend,  it  was  observed  that  the  quality  of  data  reported  on  CD’s  work  with  CPCs  and  SMCs  was  good  and  appropriate  means  of  veriﬁcation  such  as  meeting  minutes  and  pictures  had  been  uploaded  with  most  of  the  submissions;  however  during  the  ﬁeld  visit  it  was  found  out  that  the  partner’s  work  with  existing  CPCs  was  wrongly  being  entered  in  the  activities  with  inactive  CPCs  section.  It  was  then  explained  to  them  that  the  ‘work  with  existing  CPCs’  option  should  be  chosen  and  ﬁlled  while  conducting  any  activity  concerning  existing  CPCs.  CDs  work  on  facilitating  seed  money  support  and  social  protection  was  also  not  reported  in  the  October  submissions.  Confusion  over  submitting  duplicate  entries  owing  to  SSEVS  facilitating  the  livelihoods  work  for  CD  was  claimed  to  be  the  reason  for  it.  It  was  later  explained  to  them  that  they  need  to  report  the  work  done  with  households  in  their  area  even  if  the  technical  partner  is  the  one  helping  implement  it. Similarly,  in  the  case  management  section,  it  was  noticed  that  while  the  data  for  new  case  registrations  was  being  duly  reported,  no  information  was  being  submitted  on  the  follow-up  of  the  cases. The  team  was  then  reoriented  on  the  steps  for  entering  data  while  following-up  on  the  past  cases.   
Observing  Data  Entry  Processes  and  Assessing  MIS  Protocols:  Field  observations  included  two  community-level  meetings  in  Village  Keni,  Khijarsaray  Block—one  with  a  youth  group  and  another  with  the  SMC  at  a  middle-level  school.  Following  which  CMS  suggested  to  enter  data  on  the  same  in  the  Activity  MIS  tool  along  with  some  other  dummy  entries.  There  was  still  hesitancy  and  discomfort  while  navigating  the  tool  leading  to  incorrect  entry  of  data.  Features  like  partial  save  before  submission,  programmatic  knowledge  between  particular  stakeholder  and  multistakeholder  were  also  limited.  While  the  predeﬁned  input  ranges  are  being  adhered  to,  they  recommended  increasing  the  allowable  range  for  children  currently  enrolled  in  school  in  one  submission  to  over  50.  
 Repeated  Errors  and  Common  Challenges:  
●  The  dashboard  ﬁgures  for  SMC  and  CPC  meetings  were  inaccurate  because  multi-stakeholder  engagement  was  mistakenly  selected  instead  of  single-stakeholder. Community  Mobilisers  explained  that  this  confusion  arose  from  the  involvement  of  multiple  stakeholders  (e.g.,  schoolteachers,  Sarpanch,  ANM,  and  parents)  in  such  meetings.  ●  Doubts  around  the  Hindi  translation  of  certain  English  terms  in  the  questionnaire,  such  as  "surrounding,"  led  to  errors.

   ●  CMs  were  wrongly  selecting  "preparation  for  awareness  sessions"  instead  of  "conducting  awareness  sessions,"  and  choosing  "Activation  of  inactive  CPCs"  instead  of  "Activities  with  existing  CPCs."   ●  “Poonam”  name  being  shown  in  their  community  mobilisers  on  dashboard  -  needs  to  be  removed. 
Understanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  
User  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  Considerable  gaps  in  the  team’s  understanding  of  the  MIS  tool  were  evident.  Many  staff  members  had  not  utilised  the  MIS  manual,  resulting  in  a  lack  of  coordination  and  handholding  support  among  team  members.  This  contributed  to  errors  in  data  entry  and  hesitancy  in  using  the  tool  conﬁdently.  Monthly  team  meetings  failed  to  address  these  issues  adequately,  leading  to  informal  problem-solving  efforts  among  staff.  Field  staff  demonstrated  varying  levels  of  familiarity  with  SCTO.  While  the  Technical  Person  showed  a  strong  understanding,  the  Block  Outreach  Worker  and  one  Community  Mobiliser  displayed  moderate  familiarity.  The  team  was  aware  of  the  KAWACH  Activity  MIS  Manual,  but  the  absence  of  physical  or  easily  accessible  copies  meant  they  had  not  reviewed  it.  The  dashboard  ﬁgures  for  SMC  and  CPC  meetings  were  inaccurate  because  multi-stakeholder  engagement  was  mistakenly  selected  instead  of  single-stakeholder.  Community  Mobilisers  explained  that  this  confusion  arose  from  the  involvement  of  multiple  stakeholders  (e.g.,  schoolteachers,  Sarpanch,  ANM,  and  parents)  in  such  meetings. Continued  training  sessions,  with  a  focus  on  understanding  the  distinction  between  single-stakeholder  and  multi-stakeholder  engagements,  are  necessary. 
Feedback  on  MIS  utility:  The  community  mobilisers  generally  ﬁnd  the  MIS  tool  user-friendly  and  believe  that  the  current  reporting  system,  along  with  the  dashboard,  will  be  beneﬁcial  once  all  data  has  been  entered  and  any  backlog  is  cleared.  They  recognise  that  they  need  to  invest  time  in  exploring  the  tool  further  to  become  comfortable  with  it  and  to  effectively  utilise  the  dashboard  for  tracking  their  progress  against  the  targets  set  for  KAWACH.  
Future  needs  and  recommendations:  
●  In  the  dashboard,  they  suggest  bringing  detailed  indicators  on  school  level  collectives  since  that  is  a  major  part  of  their  operations. ●  Recommended  introducing  the  option  of  selecting  month  in  case  registration  so  that  backlog  can  be  entered  if  any.  ●  File  uploads  for  training  sessions  to  be  introduced.  ●  Suggested  if  we  can  specify  “Rapport  building”  with  Visiting  school,  since  strengthening  school  collectives  also  required  visiting  the  school  which  was  a  cause  of  confusion  in  the  team.

●  “i”  button  for  child  collective  meetings  with  the  names  of  villages  where  the  meeting  has  been  done  will  also  be  helpful  for  them. ●  Assistance  on  deleting  future  wrong  entries  and  duplicates.

Identiﬁcation  of  New  Challenges:  A  major  reason  ﬁeld  staff  struggle  to  allocate  sufﬁcient  time  for  SCTO  is  their  high  workload.  Each  community  mobilizer  is  responsible  for  visiting  5  villages  (15  wards)  per  month,  conducting  15  CPC  meetings,  5  youth  meetings,  5  adolescent  meetings,  and  handling  additional  community-level  activities.  This  high  volume  of  tasks  was  reported  to  contribute  to  delays  in  form  submission  timely.  Secondly,  the  challenges  with  the  tool  are  not  discussed  during  monthly  team  meetings  ,  which  results   in  informal  problem-solving  efforts  among  the  staff.  
Partner-Speciﬁc  QA  Process  Review:  The  community  mobilisers  and  Block  Coordinators  maintain  their  daily  diaries  where  they  record  meeting  agendas,  child  marriage  cases,  participant  details,  and  brief  meeting  information.  Activity  photos  with  brief  descriptions  are  shared  daily  via  WhatsApp  groups.  Activities  are  updated  monthly  in  an  internal  Excel  G-Sheet  by  the  MIS  person  during  ofﬁce  meetings,  with  cross-veriﬁcation  conducted  through  three  layers  of  review.  Additionally,  a  Kawach  monthly  report  is  prepared  for  internal  documentation,  detailing  all  activities  village-wise,  along  with  the  proceedings  and  a  gender-  and  age-wise  list  of  attendees. CD  demonstrates  strong  record-keeping  and  documentation  practices,  complemented  by  commendable  on-ground  efforts.  The  program  coordinator  is  very  active  and  enthusiastic  in  integrating  the  dashboard  and  the  MIS  tool  in  their  daily  operations.

    Observing  data  entry  process  and  assessing  MIS  protocols:  The  work  of  LEDS  centres  around  social  protection,  school  enrollment,  Learning  Resource  Centre  enrollment,  and  working  with  youth/women  groups  and  anganwadi  centres.  The  same  is  ﬁrst  entered  in  registers  manually  and  then  entered  in  the  SurveyCTO  application  by  3  people  from  the  organization  who  have  been  designated  for  it.  The  data  is  entered  once  every  2-3  days  after  the  activities  on  the  ﬁeld  have  been  completed.     Repeated  errors  and  common  challenges:  While  the  team  displayed  ease  with  using  the  application,  certain  gaps  were  observed  in  their  understanding  of  the  sections  in  the  tool. It  observed  that  some  data  points  (e.g.  work  with  parents/households  on  social  protection  or  talking  to  parents  for  entering  their  children  in  the  learning  centres)  that  was  supposed  to  be  entered  in  the  section  on  ‘Activities  surrounding  households’  or  ‘Activities  surrounding  remedial  education’  respectively  was  wrongly  entered  in  the  section  titled  ‘Activities  surrounding  parent  collectives.’  Also,  their  work  on  educating  children  in  the  LRCs  was  not  being  entered  in  the  tool.  It  was  also  seen  that  the  ﬁeld  team  was  not  uploading  appropriate  documents  for  the  means  of  veriﬁcation.  
Understanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  
User  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  Of  the  3  people  designated  to  use  the  MIS  system,  1  had  attended  the  training  session  conducted  by  CMS.  Understandably,  the  one  who  had  received  the  training  seemed  to  be  more  conﬁdent  in  using  the  tool  than  the  other  members.  Nonetheless,  she  had  built  the  capacities  of  the  other  ﬁeld  workers  to  download  the  application  and  use  it  quite  effectively.  It  was  observed  that  the  team  was  able  to  navigate  through  the  application  quite  easily,  however  challenges  were  noticed  in  their  understanding  of  using  the  different  sections  of  the  tool. To  address  such  issues,  the  team  was  oriented  on  the  sections  relevant  to  them  again  so  that  they  can  enter  information  in  the  tool  correctly. It  was  highlighted  to  them  that  work  done  on  a  daily  basis  on  educating  the  children  in  the  LRCs  should  be  entered  in  the  ‘other  activities’  sub-section  of  the  ‘Activities  surrounding  remedial  education’  section  and  that  data  on  awareness  drives  conducted  in  the  community  should  be  entered  in  the  multistakeholder  section.   The  program  coordinator  was  also  oriented  on  using  the  dashboard  to  effectively  track  the  data  being  entered  by  the  ﬁeld  team.     Feedback  on  MIS  utility:  The  ﬁeld  team  and  the  program  coordinator  found  the  SurveyCTO  tool  quite  useful  for  reporting  of  the  work  that  they  do  on  the  ground.  The  entire  team  showed  enthusiasm  for  using  the  tool  and  learning  how  to  use  it  more  effectively.

Partner-Speciﬁc  QA  Process  Review:  Overall,  the  LEDS  team  seemed  to  be  quite  at  ease  with  the  application  and  eager  to  use  the  tool.  However,  the  main  challenges  concerned  getting  clarity  on  which  section/sub-sections  should  be  used  for  reporting  the  work  that  they  engage  with  the  community  and  on  uploading  the  correct  means  of  veriﬁcation. All  such  doubts  were  resolved  by  reorienting  the  team  on  the  sections  relevant  to  them.

Veriﬁcation  of  current  tool  implementation  
Review  of  data  entries:   Taabar  being  a  shelter  home,  only  the  case  management  section  of  the  tool  is  relevant  for  them.  They  have  submitted  about  15  entries  in  the  month  of  November  with  all  the  previous  case  management  information  being  shared  with  the  CMS  team  through  the  legacy  data.    Observing  data  entry  process  and  assessing  MIS  protocols:  2  members  from  the  Taabar  team  had  attended  the  training  on  the  tool.  The  members  mentioned  that  they  are  completely  familiar  with  the  data  entry  process  and  protocol  for  case  management  and  have  not  faced  any  issues  till  now  in  entering  data  for  registering  a  new  case  or  following  up  on  it.    Repeated  errors  and  common  challenges:  During  the  visit,  the  issue  of  mismatch  between  the  case  management  numbers  shared  in  the  legacy  data  and  in  the  MPRs  was  discussed  and  the  team  replied  that  they  will  crosscheck  the  data  shared  in  both  -  legacy  and  MPR  -  and  share  the  remaining  data  with  the  CMS  team  at  the  earliest. Numbers  on  child  marriage  (CM)  had  been  wrongly  shared  by  the  Taabar

   team.  They  had  assumed  CM  refers  to  ‘children  missing’.  It  was  then  clariﬁed  that  Child  Marriage  cases  are  to  be  reported  under  CM  and  that  the  numbers  previously  shared  by  them  under  CM  need  to  be  removed  from  the  data.

User  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  The  team  mentioned  that  they  are  able  to  use  the  case  management  system  for  cases  referred  to  them  with  ease.  However,  the  statement  needs  to  be  understood  cautiously  given  that  the  team  has  only  recently  started  using  the  tool  for  reporting  their  work  and  tracking  cases.  Issues  might  crop  up  once  the  team  starts  using  the  tool  regularly,  which  we  ensured  the  team  would  be  suitably  resolved.   
Feedback  on  MIS  utility:  The  team  found  the  MIS  system  useful  for  tracking  cases  of  children  reported  to  their  organization.  They  were  oriented  to  the  dashboard  as  well  so  that  they  could  easily  track  the  data  entered  on  the  tool  over  time.    
Future  needs  and  recommendations:  The  team  did  not  provide  any  suggestions  for  improving  the  application.  Overall,  they  seemed  quite  satisﬁed  with  the  case  management  system  and  mentioned  that  the  present  system  covers  all  the  aspects  that  might  arise  in  the  effective  management  of  the  case.

However,  given  that  they  have  only  recently  started  entering  the  data  on  the  tool,  they  might  take  some  time  to  get  adept  at  using  it  and  doubts  might  come  up  later  on  which  would  need  to  be  addressed  at  that  time.

   Veriﬁcation  of  current  tool  implementation  
Review  of  data  entries:   As  compared  to  October,  the  Pardarshita  team  had  submitted  very  few  entries  (about  10  to  15)  in  November.    Observing  data  entry  process  and  assessing  MIS  protocols:  The  1st  QA  visit  had  revealed  that  the  Pardarshita  team  had  established  excellent  MIS  protocols  by  designating  1  person  at  each  LRC  for  this  MIS  work,  maintaining  separate  registers  diligently  for  all  their  work,  and  specially  scheduling  time  at  the  end  of  the  week  for  updating  all  the  weeks  work  in  the  tool. However,  this  system  was  not  followed  in  the  month  of  November  owing  to  4  members  (out  of  7)  from  the  ﬁeld  team  leaving  the  organization  permanently  and  some  opting  for  long  leaves  due  to  personal  events  (like  marriage,  health  issues  etc). It  was  told  that  the  program  team  had  also  asked  to  enter  data  with  some  delay  since  the  coordinator  wanted  to  tally/check  the  data  being  reported  in  the  MPR  and  the  one  being  updated  on  SurveyCTO.  4  new  members  had  joined  the  organization  in  place  of  the  ones  who  had  left  and  they  were  yet  to  be  oriented  on  the  tool  properly. However,  the  program  coordinator  had  ensured  that  the  new  members  download  the  application  and  go  through  the  tool  by  themselves  once.   Repeated  errors  and  common  challenges:  Of  the  total  7  members  from  the  ﬁeld  team,  only  3  members  were  from  the  older  team  and  were  well-versed  in  using  the  SurveyCTO  application.  It  was  observed  that  while  they  were  able  to  ﬁll  data  into  sections  that  were  familiar  to  them/or  which  they  had  used  previously,  they  would  panic  and  hesitate  to  use  the  tool  if  a  new  section  or  new  question  cropped  up  which  they  had  not  answered  before.  Pardarshita’s  work  on  CPCs  is  relatively  new  with  them  taking  initiative  to  form  the  CPCs  at  present. However,  this  data  was  being  entered  in  the  section  on  ‘work  with  existing  CPCs’.  It  was  explained  to  them  that  work  on  formation  of  new  CPCs  should  go  in  the  section  on  ‘work  with  new  CPCs’,  however  once  formed  the  work  with  the  CPCs  should  be  entered  in  the  section  on  ‘work  with  existing  CPCs’.  They  also  mentioned  that  certain  schools  and/or  SMCs  that  they  work  with  are  not  reﬂecting  in  the  tool.  The  list  of  schools  which  needs  to  be  added  in  the  tool  was  shared  by  the  team  and  it  was  discussed  that  this  list  would  be  added  in  the  tool  during  the  next  tool  upgrade  session.  The  case  management  section  of  the  tool  was  not  being  used  to  enter  data  on  dropouts  even  though  the  program  works  on  their  reenrollment.   
Understanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  
User  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  Due  to  a  lot  of  new  members  joining  the  Pardarshita  team  and  to  address  the  issues  faced  by  members  from  the  older  team,  the  entire  team  was  oriented  on  the  tool  again.  Each  section  that  is  relevant  to  their  work  such  as  activities  surrounding  children/youth  collectives,  remedial/bridge  education,  households,  schools/SMCs  formation  of  CPCs,  women  groups  and  community  was  explained  in  detail  while  ensuring  that  all  the  team  members  present  are  able  to  understand  and  feed  in  data  in  all  the  sub-sections  appropriately.  It  was  observed  that  the  members  were  entering  data  on  awareness

   campaigns  in  the  community  section  but  it  was  emphasised  that  such  campaign  work  will  go  under  the  multistakeholder  section  and  any  other  work  with  the  community  (such  as  identiﬁcation  of  dropouts,  cases  of  child  labour)  will  go  in  the  community  section  (for  particular  stakeholder).  The  means  of  veriﬁcation  applicable  for  the  work  they  do  and  how  to  upload  them  was  also  explained  clearly.  Given  the  organizations  extensive  work  on  reenrollment  of  dropots.  The  case  management  sections  for  registering  a  case  for  dropouts  and  following  up  with  them  were  also  explained  in  detail.    
Feedback  on  MIS  utility:  The  program  coordinator  mentioned  that  the  tool  has  been  helpful  to  them  and  especially  appreciated  the  support  provided  by  CMS  in  effectively  using  the  MIS  system.  Citing  factors  out  of  their  control  (i.e.  people  leaving,  personal  events  etc)  for  the  drastic  reduction  in  November  form  submissions,  the  coordinator  said  that  they’ll  ensure  that  the  data  is  entered  regularly  and  on  time  going  forward.  The  coordinator  also  seemed  to  have  made  efforts  in  understanding  the  dashboard  and  asked  several  questions  of  the  indicators  and  the  graphs.  Difﬁculty  in  grasping  English  sentences  quickly  seemed  to  be  a  hurdle  for  them  in  navigating  the  dashboard.  The  dashboard  was  explained  to  the  coordinator  again  and  queries  clariﬁed  (e.g.  on  understanding  indicators  on  functional  operational  CPCs/SMCs)  thereby  further  building  the  capacity  of  the  coordinator  in  using  the  dashboard.      
Future  needs  and  recommendations:  The  team  mentioned  that  they  will  regularly  utilize  the  MIS  system  going  forward;  now  that  the  team  was  reoriented  on  the  tool.  However,  they  did  not  provide  any  additional  recommendations  for  improving  the  tool.

Identiﬁcation  of  New  Challenges:  The  issue  of  effectively  training  new  members  who  join  the  organization  was  noticed  during  this  QA  visit.  Precise  protocols  could  be  set  to  ensure  the  members  transitioning  out  of  the  organization  are  training  the  new  joinees  on  the  tool  before  they  leave  so  that  work  on  ground  and  that  being  reported  in  the  application  does  not  suffer.   
Partner-Speciﬁc  QA  Process  Review:  Owing  to  different  reasons,  the  MIS  submissions  had  drastically  dropped  in  the  2nd  QA  visit  as  compared  to  the  1st.  The  team  did  not  seem  to  be  adhering  to  the  MIS  protocols  established  earlier.  However,  given  that  the  older  team  had  a  good  understanding  of  the  tool  and  they  had  helped  the  new  joinees  in  setting  up  the  tool  and  giving  context,  reorienting  the  team  on  the  tool  was  easier  and  more  effective. Despite  the  slack  in  submissions,  the  team  seemed  enthused  about  using  the  tool  properly  going  forward.

   4.4   SEWA  
 Theme  Narrative  
Veriﬁcation  of  current  tool  implementation  
Review  of  data  entries:   The  SEWA  team  submitted  127  forms  in  November,  showcasing  a  drastic  improvement  in  submissions  as  compared  to  the  very  minimal  entries  observed  during  the  1st  QA  visit.  Data  on  their  work  with  the  community,  households,  learning  centres,  households  and  women's  group  was  being  entered  by  the  ﬁeld  team.     Observing  data  entry  process  and  assessing  MIS  protocols:  Unlike  other  partners,  ﬁeld  workers  from  SEWA  have  their  work  divided  functionally  -  which  means  that  each  member  is  responsible  for  only  one  kind  of  activity  on  the  ground  (be  it  conducting  SHG  meetings,  household  surveys  etc)  every  time.  Only  work  on  organising  mega  camps  is  done  by  the  team  together.  Given  that  the  team  enters  data  in  the  application  that  they  perform  on  the  ground,  work  on  entering  data  in  the  tool  is  also  divided  functionally.  This  helps  them  in  correctly  entering  the  data  in  the  relevant  sections  as  they  do  have  to  work  with  multiple  sections.  The  fact  that  SEWA  has  a  decided  MIS  person  at  the  main  ofﬁce  also  works  to  their  advantage  as  the  ofﬁcial  checks  and  updates  the  ﬁeld  workers  on  the  status  of  their  submissions  on  a  regular  basis.    Repeated  errors  and  common  challenges:  One  of  the  main  concerns  of  SEWA  arises  due  to  the  fact  that  the  nature  of  their  work  does  not  align  exactly  with  the  sub-sections  in  the  tool.  As  mentioned  in  the  previous  QA  report  as  well,  SEWA’s  work  with  existing  SHGs  (wherein  meetings  with  1  or  2  SHGs)  are  conducted  every  data  cannot  be  reported  properly  in  the  tool  given  that  the  tool  asks  detailed  questions  only  on  the  work  with  new  SHGs  and  only  few  qualitative  questions  on  their  work  with  existing  SHGs.  The  SHG  section  thus  needs  to  be  restructured  so  that  SEWA  is  able  to  report  their  work  correctly.  The  team  also  mentioned  facing  challenges  in  reporting  their  work  with  women  individually  (particularly  collecting  data  from  them  on  their  livelihoods).  The  team  was  not  sure  in  which  section  this  data  should  be  reported. After  understanding  that  SEWA  is  at  present  surveying  these  women  from  the  women's  groups  by  visiting  their  houses  to  initiate  livelihood  activities  at  a  later  stage,  it  was  mentioned  that  this  activity  could  be  reported  in  the  ‘other  activities’  sub-section  of  the  section  on  ‘activities  surrounding  households’  and  their  livelihoods. Similar  to  the  Pardarshita  team,  it  was  observed  that  members  from  SEWA  would  hesitate  to  use  the  tool  in  case  they  counter  any  question  that  they  have  not  seen  before.  Some  of  the  team  members  also  did  not  seem  very  comfortable  with  uploading  images  wherever  required.  It  was  also  clariﬁed  that  their  work  with  the  community  on  organizing  awareness  drives  or  mega  campaigns  should  be  reported  in  the  multistakeholder  section  and  not  in  the

   community  section.  A  pertinent  question  was  on  reporting  for  social  protection  linkages  that  happened  in  mega  camps.  Post  discussing  internally,  it  was  decided  that  while  the  activity  of  organising  a  mega  camp  should  be  reported  in  the  multistakeholder  section,  the  reporting  on  the  number  of  households  linked  to  social  protection  schemes  should  be  entered  in  the  ‘activities  with  households’  section  of  the  tool.  The  program  coordinator  also  had  an  issue  in  understanding  the  indicator  labeled  ‘does  the  village/sansad  have  at  least  one  child  collective  who  is  active  and  taking  actions?’  due  to  getting  confused  over  the  meaning  of  the  word  ‘sansad’  with  bal  sansads  in  school.  It  was  then  explained  to  them  that  the  indicator  is  asking  about  active  child  collectives  in  their  wards  and  has  nothing  to  do  with  bal  sansads.  The  program  coordinator  informed  that  the  list  of  stakeholders  in  the  multistakeholder  section  needs  to  be  updated  as  some  stakeholders  that  are  an  important  part  of  their  multistakeholder  meetings  are  not  listed  in  the  tool  (the  SEWA  coordinator  has  shared  the  list  of  remaining  stakeholders  with  the  CMS  team).   
Understanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  
User  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  The  SEWA  team  showed  a  great  improvement  in  using  the  application  in  the  2nd  QA  visit  as  compared  to  the  ﬁrst. Results  from  tool  reorientation  provided  during  the  1st  QA  visit  were  clearly  evident  in  the  2nd  visit,  with  all  the  members  being  quite  at  ease  with  navigating  through  the  sections  effectively.  Queries  arose  particularly  due  to  the  lack  of  alignment  between  SEWA’s  work  on  ground  (with  SHGs  and  women)  and  the  tool  structure.  Restructuring  and  reﬁning  the  questions  in  the  tool  could  potentially  enable  the  team  to  enter  their  work  in  the  relevant  sections  quickly  and  effectively,  thus  avoiding  any  confusion  on  it.  Which  documents/images  constitute  the  correct  means  of  veriﬁcation  was  explained  to  the  team  along  with  the  steps  to  upload  the  images.  The  social  protection  section  for  households  was  also  explained  again  so  that  it  is  clear  to  the  ﬁeld  workers  that  they  need  to  report  the  number  of  ‘households’  and  not  ‘individuals’  and  the  difference  between  households  with  0  prior  scheme  linkage  and  additional  scheme  linkage  is  evident.   New  features  in  the  dashboard  were  explained  to  the  MIS  person  present  and  he  found  them  to  be  extremely  useful  in  tallying  the  data.       
Feedback  on  MIS  utility:  The  team  reported  being  satisﬁed  with  the  tool,  and  displayed  greater  comfort,  ease  and  interest  in  using  the  application  at  present  as  compared  to  the  last  time.  The  program  coordinator  was  also  largely  satisﬁed  with  the  ﬁeld  team’s  effort  and  exclaimed  that  the  team  would  use  the  MIS  system  more  productively  if  the  changes  that  they  require  are  incorporated  in  the  tool.   
Future  needs  and  recommendations:  The  team  inquired  about  getting  certain  sections  of  the  tool  restructured  and  contextualized  to  their  working  situations  on  ground  so  that  they  can  use  the  tool  effectively.  No  other  suggestions  were  reported  apart  from  this  request.

Identiﬁcation  of  New  Challenges:  Apart  from  the  challenges  listed  above,  no  major  new  challenges  were  identiﬁed  in  this  QA  visit.    
Partner-Speciﬁc  QA  Process  Review:  Overall,  the  partner  showed  a  signiﬁcant  improvement  in  the  capacity  of  the  ﬁeld  team  to  use  the  MIS  system  effectively. That  the  team  members  sought  clariﬁcation  on  a  lot  of  ﬁner  elements  essential  for  data  entry  pointed  towards  the  fact  that  the  members  were  using  the  tool  regularly  and  were  eager  to  get  their  doubts  clariﬁed.

KAWACH MEL - Comprehensive partner 
assessment 
July 2024 
In the first half of July 2024, the CMS team conducted in -depth field visits to all partner 
organizations. The objective of these visits was to conduct a thorough assessment across four 
key areas to establish a comprehensive and inclusive MEL system. This system aims to be well-
understood by all part ners during the gating period and will serve as a foundation for the 
Kawach program in the coming years. 
1. Gaining a deeper understanding of the program from the partners' perspective, 
including ongoing on-ground progress and program activities. 
2. Evaluating the current MIS systems to track outcomes and activities, understanding of 
C2I indicators and KPIs within the partners, and detailed understanding of their existing 
data systems and record-keeping practices along with technology awareness. 
3. Providing in-depth guidance to the partners on the MPR format, addressing any doubts 
and queries they had, and gathering inputs on the first draft of the MPR format. This 
included discussing challenges faced in filling out the data for June 2024 and identifying 
potential improvements for version 2, which will be used for July 2024 data. The team 
also gathered feedback and recommendations on preferred technologies and data 
systems that would be user-friendly for a tech-enabled MIS system. 
4. Identifying gaps in the understanding of indicators, reporting, and technology 
infrastructure across the partners, as well as the effort required to address these gaps. 
In addition to these planned activities, the team also took note of any overall concerns and 
questions raised by the partners to ensure an inclusive approach, providing voice to the 
partners. 
A two-member team visited each state for a period of 3-6 days in each state in the first half of 
June 2024.  
The following summary report compiles our insights and recommendations from the visits to 
all 18 partners across four states into two sections: 
Section 1: A summary of insights, challenges, and recommendations, including a partner -wise 
overview with a quantitative assessment score based on four themes stated above. 
Section 2: A detailed partner-wise qualitative narrative report organised according to the four 
themes.   
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/) 4 
Section 1: Summary Report 
Understanding of KAWACH, on ground progress on program  
activities 
1. Most of the partners have understood the expectations under the KAWACH programme 
and have aligned their work towards protection, prevention and system strengthening 
compared to our assessment from the visit in May24.  
2. The progress of program implementation varies across different states and partners. Efforts 
to strengthen systems and institutions have begun, particularly in areas where partners 
already had a presence. Progress is slower in new regions, as building trust  with the 
community and mobilizing community -based groups takes time. Additionally, some 
partners have relatively new program teams, which may affect their understanding and 
implementation of the program (such as BSA in WB, ROSA in UP followed by PGS). These 
will require additional handholding support from the state leads/zonal BAT teams. 
3. On-the-ground activities, such as activating School Management Committees (SMCs), Child 
Protection Committees (CPCs), and youth groups, as well as gradually introducing child 
protection topics in Self-Help Group (SHG) meetings, have started, especially in areas where 
partners already have an established presence. 
Understanding reporting indicators- C2I  
While overall there was an acceptance and understanding of the indicators, nuances on 
definitions and inclusions are not clear to all partners and could affect reporting. Hence all KPI 
and indicator definitions must be clearly written. This must be made clearly and 
comprehensively defined in the MPRs/associated guidebooks/toolkits. 
• For e.g., where to report elopement, teen pregnancies, consensual live -in 
relationships within minors, consensual live-in relationships of a minor with an adult, 
and consensual live-in relationships of a minor with an adult or an older adult 
o It was discussed that a separate category should be added for these. 
• Similarly, definition of a survivor – is it as per FIR or reporting to CPC, community 
group, etc.? 
o It was decided that formal reporting is not necessary.  Identification of a child as 
a victim of any child exploitation would be considered under a survivor. 
• If a child marriage was stopped but then occurred, should it be counted?  
o It was decided that if it was stopped during outside of a reporting period, it could 
change in the later reporting period, however, if it was stopped and then the 
marriage occurred within the same period it would not be reported. 
• Definition of irregular in school and state wise variation within the definition 
o It was decided that state definitions would hold precedence, however it would be 
made uniform in the gating period (45 days of continuous absence) as well.  
• Definition of an SMC or VEC (an equivalent institution in WB) state wise variation 
within the definition 
o It was decided that the institution definition be broad and inclusive of all states     
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/) 5 
MPR format feedback  
1. Overall, the first version of the MPR was well received by most partners, and they provided 
constructive feedback on adding indicators, requesting clarifications on definition on 
indicators, and asking for a bilingual version (especially partners in the Hindi speaking 
states). All the changes and feedback will be incorporated in version 2 which will also be 
bilingual. This version will be shared by 31st July 2024. 
2. Almost all partners requested a space for narrative feedback with each KPI category in the 
MPR format. This is often because the partners feel that the numbers do not provide 
adequate justification to the overall effort that goes behind the number and want to explain 
that better. Especially when they report zero, they feel that it will be perceived negatively 
and want to explain the context through narration. This will also be added in the v2 of the 
MPR format for July 2024 data. 
3. Most of the partners requested the need for an activity-based MIS- this is because in their 
perception the efforts behind the KPIs are often not understood well. Additionally, it will 
create systems for them to easily track which may or may not be present for all partners. 
They also wanted this information on activities with themselves so they could compare 
cumulative progress against their targets. 
Capacity building  
As expected, the capacity of the partners in reporting and using technology varied. Larger 
organisations or those with a longer association with BAT showed better preparedness, 
systems and readiness, while smaller organizations or newly joined partners will need training 
and capacity building on data reporting systems, formats and technology interface. The 
partners who will need higher handholding support include WB (BSA), UP (PGS), Bihar (BMVS, 
CD) and Rajasthan (LEDS, Pardarshita, and Sewa). The detailed partner-wise scores are 
provided below in the summary reports. 
Foreseeable challenges in MEL 
KAWACH work involves system strengthening, there is a reliance on government bodies for 
clarity. For example, the accountability for implementing Mission Vatsalaya in Rajasthan has 
been unclear between the Ministry of Women and Child Development and Minist ry of Child 
rights, despite CCP's ongoing efforts to establish this accountability. Until this is resolved, the 
outcomes related to strengthening CPCs may not be achievable, and the efforts made will only 
be evident through a narrative report.  
The team was trying to ascertain from partners the processes, mechanisms and systems on 
how the data is captured/aggregated for reporting in MPRs and whether the evidence behind 
could be verified, validated by the partners themselves or by an independent p arty.  For e.g., 
how is SMC strengthening being tracked by partners (through staff/volunteer participation, 
meeting attendance/minutes) or whether child protection agenda is being discussed in SHGs 
(through minutes) or how out of school children or irregular children are being tracked. While 
the processes/evidence behind the numbers varied across partners based on their current MEL 
understanding and team capacity/strength, as of now, the indicators around enrollment, social  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/) 6 
protection, and livelihoods, rehabilitation, survivors have better evidence-backed mechanisms 
compared to the other indicators. 
One challenge that arises in any Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) process during 
system strengthening is determining whether the information from existing systems accurately 
reflects the on -ground situation or if there are systemic loopholes in t he reported data. For 
instance, are the numbers of out -of-school children based on school data underestimated to 
present more favorable reporting outcomes for the education system? Or are the meeting 
attendances of SMC members merely formalities, possibly involving financial incentives? To 
address this, partners should provide self-reported scores on the strength of the evidence and 
data they report through narratives and the MEL system should be agile to include these when 
understanding/analysing the progr ess on outcomes. It is also important for partners to 
understand this perspective throughout the programme. 
The program team and partners should use the gating period to continually refine 
implementation through a prevention lens across vulnerable groups. For example, while 
consensual sex between teenagers may not be reported or tracked, it is important for on -
ground partners to engage with these vulnerable groups and educate them about 
contraceptive use to help prevent cases of teen pregnancies which are to be reported.

Partner wise summary  
*The scores below range from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates low levels of effort and 5 indicates the highest level of effort already put in or needed. For program 
activities, current MIS, and MPR feedback, higher scores are better, indicating significant efforts made. However, for the capacity-building score, a higher 
score means more effort is needed, as it shows that there is more room for improvement. These scores are based on the team's assessment of the current 
situation.

West 
Bengal 
CLPOA ● Having been part of the Prevention of Trafficking 
program under BAT since April 2022, CLPOA has a 
strong understanding of child protection. Under 
KAWACH, CLPOA has clarity on most activities and 
is currently exploring new activities such as 
strengthening SMCs and creating child safety 
corners. While CLPOA is a mature organization, there 
is room for improvement in their proactive efforts to 
link vulnerable households to schemes. 
● Comprehensive systems and various formats are 
established for data maintenance and reporting 
across operational areas. 
● More clarity on the operational and function 
indicators for SMC is needed. 
4 4 3 3 
BSA ● BSA was recently onboarded under Kawach and they 
come with a very new team with little experience 
along with a new geography. Currently, they are 
2 2 2 5  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       8 
 
focused on understanding the KAWACH program. 
However, as per them their understanding and 
progress has been slow and delayed because of a 
series of events (vulnerability mapping, multiple visits 
from technical partners, the BAT team, etc). 
Currently, they face challenges in their operations 
and require capacity building in activity execution, 
case management workflows, and the reporting 
structure under the KAWACH program. 
● The feedback on the MPR was not so positive, this is 
likely because BSA did not seem comfortable in their 
understanding of the KPIs. They were unable to 
understand how data from activities were to be 
translated and aggregated to get the monthly KPI 
numbers.  
CRY DJ ● As expected, CRY-DJ is the most mature organisation 
in terms of their understanding of the KAWACH 
program and its themes, and the child protection 
domain. Having a large team with experienced 
animators, CRY -Dooars Jagoron has achieved 
significant reach and  rapport with the community. 
They are also well versed in the necessary processes 
and means to bring about a change.   
● However, unlike other partners in North Bengal, they 
face contextual challenges, unique to the tribal tea 
garden community that they are working with which 
has possible implications on their reporting on KPIs. 
● The partner critically analysed all the indicators, and 
the CMS team was able to clear up  most doubts. 
Overall, they felt the new MPR is better and easy to

adopt/report. 
SPMUS ● SPMUS faces prevalent issues of child trafficking and 
child marriage, influenced by cross -border 
interactions and a population that adheres to distinct 
marriage laws. Additionally, existing community 
structures also influence these. SPMUS, with its 
experience, has a stronghold on the activities and 
rapport with formal institutions and stakeholders. 
They effectively navigate challenges through  their 
contacts, continuously strengthening various systems 
and institutions along the way. Overall, SPMUS is a 
mature organisation in terms of understanding the 
KAWACH program and its operations. 
● Comprehensive systems and various formats are 
established for data maintenance and reporting 
across operational areas. 
● No issue is faced in understanding indicators or 
definitions in MPR.

Uttar 
Pradesh 
MSEMVS ● The project continues in the same block/region 
where they previously worked with BAT with 
addition of 17 new villages, most of the team (70%) 
also continues. 
● The program team has a well -defined planning and 
reporting structure at all levels, ensuring clear 
communication of targets and achievements to the 
program lead, even though reporting at the 
community mobiliser and block level is currently 
manual. 
● The team liked the new MPR format and suggested a 
4 
 
4 4 3  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       10 
 
addition of a few additional indicators such as 
a. Number of training sessions conducted for CPCs 
(Child Protection Committees) and SMCs (School 
Management Committees). 
b. Frequency of district -level meetings for CPCs, 
SMCs, and advocacy efforts. 
● The team needs training in two areas: 1) identifying 
and capturing compelling case stories for community 
mobilisers, and 2) technical skills development for 
ground staff. 
PGS ● The organisation has earlier worked with BAT in 24 
villages of the same blocks which gives them the 
advantage of working in a known geography - they 
know stakeholders within the village, at the block 
level so liaising and system strengthening is relatively 
easy. 
● A critical gap was found during the review in the MIS 
system. There is currently no well-defined action plan 
or standardised MIS reporting format, hindering 
effective monitoring and progress tracking. 
● The program team encounters skill gaps along with 
collaboration challenges and requires capacity 
building on technical and reporting aspects. 
● Team members acknowledged the merits of the MPR, 
but a key challenge lies in obtaining the necessary 
data considering their current MIS systems are weak 
and likely to be insufficient for capturing all the 
information needed for the report.

compared to other partners within the state, 
2

potentially leading to a slower pace of programme 
execution. Ongoing floods has also hampered their 
ability to strengthen field activities 
● The partner stated that time taken for reporting (1 
week per level) limits their ability to directly engage 
with the community. 
● The organisation appreciated the new MPR format 
and will need support for the technical training of 
their field team to make reporting effective. 
 
Bihar SSEVS ● On child protection, they worked on reintegration 
earlier -this work will be phased out by December 
2024 
● SSEVS works as a technical partner for livelihoods via 
promoting vegetable farming, mushroom cultivation 
and goatery (farmers trained directly by SSEVS at 
present will train partners in the next phase).  
● They connect 18+ youth to skill development plans 
(vocational courses such as training in automobile 
repairs, as electricians and on soft skills etc.) and offer 
employment support as well.  
● Using inbuilt application for reporting, and a 
proficient team using Kobo toolbox for monitoring 
● MPR may not be relevant as a technical partner, but 
they wish to report their work on survivors. They 
requested that they report narratives of the change 
along with the numbers.   
5 5 4 2 
BMVS ● BMVS’s work focuses on capacity building and 
strengthening institutions on child protection (work 
with SMCs/ward level CPCs and work through youth 
groups.

marriage in the last 6 months.  
● Difficult to use MPR as they are used to working with 
google forms 
● Will need in person training and handholding support 
understanding the indicators and using tech-enabled 
platforms. 
TSN ● The partner’s work is focused on child protection 
now, earlier it was more on rescue and rehabilitation. 
● All the areas chosen under Kawach are new for the 
partner (30 wards in 10 villages of 5 panchayats in 
Azamnagar block of Katihar district) 
● They are working on SMC/W -CPC strengthening, 
education through bridge courses, enrollment, social 
protection, livelihood through SHGs, and on survivor 
collective and CVCs. 
● Current data collection is manual and entered  into 
excel once a month

Section 2: Narrative Report 
1. West Bengal 
1.1 CLPOA (City Level Program of Action)  
 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● CLPOA operates in 30 sansads across 17 villages within a single panchayat in North 24 Parganas, located 30 
minutes from Barasat. Having been part of the Prevention of Trafficking program under BAT since April 2022, the 
organisation has a strong understanding of child protection. Under KAWACH, CLPOA has clarity on most activities 
and is currently exploring new activities such as strengthening SMCs and creating child safety corners. While 
CLPOA is a mature organization, there is room for improvement in their proactive efforts to link vulnerable 
households to schemes. 
● The organization has successfully formed 32 children's collectives, conducting 1-2 sessions per month with 
additional quarterly sessions on leadership and awareness. CLPOA has a clear understanding of session 
management, including material preparation, conducting learning activities through games, maintaining attendance 
registers, documenting meeting minutes, and collecting quantitative data on collective members and their friends 
who join. 
● Parents' groups have also been established. 
● All 30 sansads have established VLCPCs comprising 12 members each. These committees hold monthly sessions 
and act on reported cases by forwarding them to the police. Additionally, CLPOA collaborates with VLCPC 
members to create an annual budget for inclusion in the GPDP, which is presented at panchayat meetings. 
● Awareness camps and campaigns are conducted as needed, often inviting resource people from CWC and DLSA. 
For awareness on rehabilitation, a resource person from a government counseling clinic is also invited. 
● Vulnerable children are identified through collectives, parents' groups, VLCPCs, Asha workers, and field visits. The 
most prevalent issues are dropouts, child marriage, and child labor. 
○ Contributing factors to dropouts include mobile addiction, peer pressure to earn money, lack of parental 
supervision, alcoholic parents, and lack of documents. Once children drop out, they often engage in labour  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       18 
 
to support their families financially. 
○ The high number of child marriages is influenced by the distinct marriage laws within the predominantly 
Muslim community. 
● Dropouts/irregulars above the age of 15 are difficult to work with since the law doesn’t include them and getting 
documents for them takes more than usual time. CLPOA has also put this issue forward in the panchayat office. 
● Animators conduct daily home and field visits, gathering valuable information on community issues. They diligently 
follow up on irregular, dropped-out, and re-enrolled children, households in the process of obtaining documents, 
and any cases of child marriage through calls and visits. 
● Missing documents are a significant issue. Animators collect details from households without documents and 
provide extensive guidance on obtaining them. However, they only occasionally accompany community members 
to expedite the process. 
● Activities related to SMCs are new to CLPOA. Although SMCs were formed some time ago, they are currently 
non-functional. Out of 23 schools, only 3 are high schools with SMCs; the others have VECs. CLPOA is currently 
working to collect the list of all committee members from the schools. They are hesitant about the operational and 
functional conditions of the SMCs, given the ground realities. 
● Vocational training centres for older children are present but around Barasat which is a bit far from their 
implementing ground. 
Current MIS • With a team of 8 animators, 2 project coordinators, and 1 MEL coordinator, CLPOA facilitates the program on the 
ground. Comprehensive systems and various formats are established for data maintenance and reporting across 
operational areas. 
• Key formats include attendance sheets, meeting minutes, home visit records, case management forms, dropout 
handling formats, SP documentation tracking, and case management physical registers. 
• Animators maintain daily diaries and fill up the above formats later. The MEL Coordinator uses those formats to get 
the data and add it to any reporting formats from BAT’s end.  
• Monthly Qualitative reports having summary and outcomes of activities done are also maintained with the next 
month’s plan.  
MPR Feedback ● The team critically analysed all the indicators, clearing out most of the doubts. Overall, they felt the new MPR is 
better and easy to report.   
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       19 
 
● Requested for activity level MIS since a lot of activities are done on ground to arrive at one KPI, and they feel like 
those are not getting valued. 
● Not comfortable with reporting 0s in the MPR. 
 
● Additions and Queries: 
○ Queries on operational and functional SMCs. 
○ Alternative livelihoods 
○ If a single child has experienced 3 abuses, and the current status of all the 3 cases are taken in a single 
follow up home visit, how are they supposed to report it?  
○ Once a child marriage is stopped involving police, the child can be married off the next week from their 
aunt’s place. Should that be reported as Stopped? If the marriage is again stopped, is it two marriages 
stopped or one? 
○ Request to add a remarks column 
Capacity 
building 
● If more indicators are added or new formats are created, CLPOA needs a proper run-through of all the new 
indicators for their clarity.  
● More clarity on the operational and function indicators for SMC is needed. 
 
1.2 BSA (Bal Suraksha Abhiyan) 
 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● BSA is operating in 15 sansads in 2 blocks of Darjeeling district, covering both plain and hilly tea garden regions. 
BSA was recently onboarded under BAT in April 2024 and comes with a very new team with little experience along 
with a new geography. Currently they are focusing on understanding the KAWACH program, forming collectives 
and building rapport with the community. However, their progress has been hampered by a series of events, such 
as vulnerability mapping and multiple visits from technical partners and the BAT team. As a result, they face 
challenges in their operations and require capacity building in activity execution, case management workflows, and 
the reporting structure under the KAWACH program.  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       20 
 
● BSA has successfully formed 5 child collectives to date. Planning and gaining clarity on the next steps with these 
collectives.  
● They have initiated home visits and tea garden visits, engaging with children, trade union leaders, and parents to 
gain insights into community issues. 
● Identification of out of school children is being done through child collectives and community visits along with 
mapping out the reasons: 
○ Reintegration into schools after covid has been tough. 
○ Some children are not linked to any scheme for various reasons, they end up feeling left out in school and 
hence do not want to go to school. 
○ Most of the community comprises tribal people but their ST certificates are not made. Along with that Birth 
certificates are also rare.  
○ Long distance traveling. 
● They have conducted 5 parent meetings where challenges faced were discussed. 80% of parents don’t have their 
caste certificate. Animators provide guidance on the procedure for addressing missing documents but there is a 
serious issue of delay in obtaining the documents. Follow-ups are conducted to track the status of documentation 
retrieval. 
● VLCPCs were established long ago but are currently non-functional.  There is a need to form them again. BSA is 
awaiting a letter from CDPO to the Panchayats to operationalise VLCPCs by the end of the month. 
● SMCs don’t exist here as well.  Instead, management committees, which are selected rather than elected, are in 
place. BSA is planning to track the members in those committees so that they can be worked with.  
● Main issues prevalent here are adolescents living together, trafficking to Siliguri for domestic labour, Substance 
abuse and irregular children in schools. 
● Case management workflows are not set up here yet. 
Current MIS ● BSA has 4 animators, 1 MEL coordinator and 1 project coordinator who are greatly focused on aligning with the 
various activities under KAWACH and its reporting structures. 
● Meeting minutes are documented in physical registers along with the next planned date of meeting. 
● Scanned documents of these are given to the MEL person who maintains the digital copies.  
● Home visit updates are put on WhatsApp for now, their plan is to make registers for the same. 
● Monthly qualitative reports are made by compiling and summarizing all the 4 animators' work.  
MPR Feedback ● Not so positive feedback on the MPR. BSA did not seem comfortable with the KPIs. They were unable to  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       21 
 
understand how data from activities were to be translated and aggregated to get the monthly KPI numbers.  
● A lot of KPIs did not make sense to them since their contract with BAT did not have those activities listed. For 
example, forming survivor collectives, strengthening SHGs, and awareness of financial literacy. 
● They were not at all comfortable in reporting 0s in the MPR and requested for the activity level MIS.  
● Addition: 
○ Remarks column.  
○ Education tab, 7.1 section - add trade union community leaders or tea garden management.  
Capacity 
building 
● Capacity Building and training on the activities as well as the reporting format is a necessity for BSA.  
● The Case Management workflow should also be made more clear to them. 
● Clarity on how KPIs emerge from activities and then lead to C2Is is needed. 
 
1.3 CRY - Dooars Jagoron 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● CRY is carrying out its implementation through Dooars Jagoron in the tea gardens of Jalpaiguri. They are operating 
in 83 sansads spread across 3 panchayats. It is one of the most mature organisations in terms of their 
understanding of the KAWACH program and its themes, and the child protection domain. Having a large team with 
experienced animators, CRY-Dooars Jagoron has achieved significant reach and rapport with the community. They 
are also well versed in the processes necessary to bring about a change.  However, like other partners in North 
Bengal, they face challenges, unique to the tribal tea garden community they are dealing with which has possible 
implications on their reporting on KPIs. 
● The organization has successfully formed child collectives in all 83 sansads, each comprising 25 children. 
● Monthly meetings are also conducted for the parents' collectives. 
● VLCPCs and Panchayat CPCs have been established and are mostly functional across the area. Efforts are ongoing 
to strengthen the Block Level CPC, which is currently not functional. Each sansad holds a monthly VLCPC meeting. 
● Awareness camps are organized as needed, focusing on child protection issues, children’s rights, social security 
schemes, and school dropouts. The organization adopts a multi-faceted approach to problem-solving.  
For example: An area has a lot of dropouts initiated by missing documents.  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       22 
 
○ Now with parents, they will conduct an awareness camp on how to obtain the missing documents, going 
over the details of the procedure. 
○ On the other hand, camps with schoolteachers to raise awareness of RTE 2009 Act which allows for 
children’s school enrollment even without documents. 
● The most prevalent issues in this region are Child labour, child trafficking, irregular children or dropouts, 
adolescents moving out of house to live together and substance abuse. 
○ Living Together: 
■ The issue of living together is really concentrated in the context of tea gardens in North Bengal. 
Adolescents, when facing any inconvenience at home, mostly choose to move in with their partners 
without marriage in the same community. Any combination of age group is seen, the boy being 
older or the girl being older.  
■ This practice is widely accepted in the community, and separating such couples, especially by the 
girl’s parents, is frowned upon. 
■ Living together has similar consequences to child marriage, as enrolled children often drop out of 
school and enter child labor to sustain their lives together. 
○ Seasonal Child Labour: 
■ The months of summer are the plucking season for tea leaves. Children during summer vacation get 
involved in this activity for their own pocket money. Parents do not coerce them, but the result is a 
noticeable rise in child labour during this period. 
○ Child trafficking: 
■ Child trafficking and child sexual abuse (CSA) are deeply hidden issues within these communities. 
Awareness campaigns have gradually brought these issues to light. Traffickers, referred to as 
'agents,' often target children in Jalpaiguri, promising better education in Sikkim but ultimately 
placing them in domestic labor. 
■ The agents maintain good relationships with the parents and even take them to see off their child in 
Sikkim. Law enforcement faces challenges in addressing these cases due to parental consent, as 
parents often believe they are providing better opportunities for their children, not realizing the 
true nature of trafficking.  
○ Substance Abuse: 
■ 11–16-year-old children get into consumption of alcohol and various kinds of drugs. 
● Dropouts are identified through daily interactions with the collectives, schools, anganwadis, parents, and the  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       23 
 
community. Animators actively enroll dropouts and conduct regular follow-ups to ensure their continued 
education. 
○ Through a study they conducted, they found out that boys are way more susceptible to dropouts while girls 
are a bit more disciplined. 
○ Children are not getting good knowledge on basic numeracy and language during their preprimary and 
primary standards. Hence when they graduate to higher classes, they are not able to grasp advanced topics 
and eventually lose interest and drop out.  
○ Schools are far away from the tea gardens; hence transportation becomes a problem. 
○ As parents go out to work in the morning and return in the evening children are left unsupervised 
throughout the day. This lack of supervision contributes to irregular school attendance and higher dropout 
rates.  
○ Missing documents are an issue faced here as well. The delay in obtaining the documents is exacerbated 
because of parents being daily wage workers.  When they visit the centre or panchayat to get their 
documents made, they are often asked to make more visits. This would mean they have to choose to let go 
of their daily wage for several days, which many cannot afford. 
● The organization has identified that there is a major gap in parents’ perspectives on their children’s education and 
career. To address this, they have planned to develop Parenting Models where parents will be educated on how 
their absence contributes to dropouts and other cases of exploitation. They are also planning to strengthen the 
relationships among teachers, students and parents to collaboratively address the issue of dropouts. 
● SMCs don’t exist in high schools. Some management committees are set up and Village Education Committees 
(VECs) operate in primary schools. The organization is facing difficulty in working with education institutions since 
they are so little functional. So, they are working to strengthen them by identifying members and planning initial 
sessions. 
● The organization is planning to create school safety nets through school development plans, developed in 
collaboration with the panchayat, teachers, and school committees. 
● Learning centers exist and dropouts or irregular students who need extra support are linked to these centers. But 
bridge courses are not provided by the schools. 
● Children cabinets, Kanyashree club, eco club exist in most of the schools. They are trying to bring about change by 
strengthening these.  
● Animators guide families through the process of obtaining documents needed to access social security schemes, 
sometimes accompanying them based on the need.  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       24 
 
● Vocational training centers are identified, but they offer skills such as hotel management and beautician courses 
for children over 18. Very few centers are available for computer learning or spoken English for those under 18. 
This would impact their reporting on this relevant KPI. 
● The organization tracks vulnerable households through daily home visits, identifying at-risk children, dropouts, and 
other cases. These visits also build awareness and provide guidance on obtaining necessary documents. 
● CRY- Dooars Jagoron has a well-established case management workflow. Once a case is identified, it is 
immediately reported to the VLCPC for further action. 
● Mass enrollment camps are organized during school admission periods to ensure maximum student enrollment 
● Migration registers are being created for all sansads, with 11 completed so far. 
● The organization does not directly work with SHGs and does not provide seed money or microloans. 
● Survivors’ collectives are impossible to form according to the project coordinator. Survivor numbers are low and 
they might be from sansads which are far away from each other. Moreover, they also raised the fact that the 
identity of a child involved in a POCSO case cannot be revealed by law and hence they can’t be part of these 
survivor collectives. 
Current MIS ● With 16 animators, 2 MEL coordinators and 2 project coordinators, Dooars Jagoron has a large team involved in 
their rigorous routine of daily activities. 
● Daily activities are divided into two sessions - Morning and Afternoon. The morning session comprises activities 
like visiting the GP office, contacting ICDS, Asha workers etc. Does not involve home visits since parents are not 
available. The afternoon session comprises activities like collective meetings, group meetings, home visits. 
● Animators maintain their daily diary, compile their data into multiple physical formats and register later. 
Afterwards, the MEL coordinators digitize the same into excel sheets. 
MPR Feedback ● Not so positive feedback on the MPR. BSA did not seem comfortable with the KPIs. They were unable to 
understand how data from activities were to be translated and aggregated to get the monthly KPI numbers.  
● A lot of KPIs did not make sense to them since their contract with BAT did not have those activities listed. For 
example, forming survivor collectives, strengthening SHGs, and awareness on financial literacy. 
● They were not at all comfortable in reporting 0s in the MPR and requested for the activity level MIS.  
● Addition: 
○ Remarks column.  
○ Education tab, 7.1 section - add trade union community leaders or tea garden management.

1.4 SPMUS (Suprava Panchashila Mahila Uddyog Samity) 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● SPMUS is currently working in 17 sansads spread over 2 Gram panchayats in 1 block in the Bangladesh border 
region of Murshidabad district. They face prevalent issues of child trafficking and child marriage, influenced by 
cross-border interactions and a population adhering to distinct marriage laws. Additionally, existing community 
structures (based on religion, and caste) also influence these. SPMUS, being in this space for quite some time, has a 
stronghold on the activities and rapport with formal institutions and stakeholders. They leverage their knowledge 
and reach to advocate and conduct various sessions at the grassroot level involving resource people from district 
level, legal institution, police, etc. They effectively navigate challenges through their contacts, continuously 
strengthening various systems and institutions along the way. Overall, SPMUS is a mature organization in terms of 
understanding the KAWACH program and its operations. 
● They have successfully established 34 Child 'Clubs' across various sansads, with two clubs per sansad. These clubs 
hold bi-monthly sessions facilitated by SPMUS, adhering to the modules provided by BAT. Each sansad has a core 
group of three children responsible for mobilising and informing their peers about the sessions, ensuring active 
participation and engagement. Along with club members, often their friends also turn up in these meetings. Plans 
are underway to form Youth Collectives for children who have crossed the age of 18, providing a platform for 
continued support and development. 
● Parent Collectives are already formed. Monthly meetings are conducted to educate parents on laws, schemes, 
exploitation cases.  These sessions aim to empower parents with knowledge and resources to better support their  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       26 
 
children.  
● SPMUS conducts need-based sessions with Panchayat members, initiated through proposals sent to the 
panchayats. SPMUS team and PRI members coordinate on the date of the session and then all members of the 
panchayat are mobilised, by both Pradhan/Secretary and the animators of SPMUS. These meetings, occasionally 
attended by the Executive Officer, cover critical issues such as exploitation cases, laws, schemes, roles and 
responsibilities of the PRI members in handling exploitation cases. DCPU, CWC units and ISDP are also approached 
as needed. 
● VLCPCs are already set up.  
○ VLCPC members involve SPMUS animators in their monthly meetings. These focus on discussing cases and 
addressing challenges encountered during case reporting. Regular contact with CWC, DCPU, and the police 
helps mitigate these challenges. ISDP coordinators are contacted from the panchayat who liaise with 
Executive Officers regarding the utilization of funds allocated for child protection cases. 
○ VLCPC capacity building sessions are tailored around various topics determined by SPMUS. For sessions on 
law, policy, and legalities, the organization contacts DCPU and CWC to provide resource persons, making 
the sessions interactive and engaging through activities and feedback. 
● An annual convergence meeting at the district level is planned in collaboration with DCPU and CWC. Invitations 
will be extended to various district level departments through a letter by DCPU including the ADM, DLSA, labor, 
education, and medical departments, along with local NGOs and child helplines. Stakeholders from the police 
department like Superintendent of police will also be invited.  
● Dropouts/irregular/out of school children are identified through their child clubs and home visits. Schools don’t 
provide any data on dropouts.  
○ Many parents are farmers who struggle to understand the value of education. The poor financial conditions 
of households often compel children to engage in labor to supplement the family income. This economic 
pressure leads to a tendency to prioritize immediate earnings over long-term educational benefits, resulting 
in high dropout rates. 
○ Phone addiction is on the rise which keeps them distracted from education.  
○ The lack of job opportunities in West Bengal influences parental attitudes towards education. “If there are 
no jobs in the market, how will education help our children? Better they migrate with fathers and earn some 
money” is often heard from parents. 
○ The region has a significant Muslim population, where different marriage laws are followed. This results in 
frequent child marriages, and in many cases, in-laws do not permit child brides to continue their education,  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       27 
 
effectively ending their schooling. 
○ Lack of documents, mainly aadhaar and birth certificates, also pose a barrier to enrollment. 
● Children in need of extra support are linked to free courses provided by locals. SPMUS recognises the need for 
formal remedial education / bridge course centers to be established.  
● Dropouts/irregulars above the age of 15 are difficult to work with since the law doesn’t include them and getting 
documents for them takes more than usual time.  
● The organization faces significant difficulties in collaborating with the education department. While School 
Management Committees (SMCs) exist in most high schools, the members and their roles remain unclear. To date, 
the organization has only managed to meet with teachers from one school. In primary schools, Village Education 
Committees (VECs) no longer exist, and the main contacts are now sub-inspectors or head teachers. Additionally, 
teachers are often uncooperative, requiring permission from higher authorities.  
○ These challenges were raised by SPMUS at an NGO forum conducted by the Additional District Magistrate 
(ADM). A letter will be issued to SPMUS granting permission to address exploitation cases and educational 
issues, which can be presented when encountering barriers. 
● They have conducted various sessions with school children and are planning to conduct sessions on Safe touch in 
the coming months. They also work to strengthen student collectives like Meena Manch.  
● SPMUS puts in efforts for identifying households and children without essential documents and guiding them 
through the documentation process. Animators assist families with online applications and maintain follow-ups 
with the DM office. GP members are contacted as needed, and documentation updates are managed through 
WhatsApp, with the MEL coordinator tracking progress online. 
● The organization has identified vocational centers and efforts are being made to link older children (17.5 years and 
above) with them.  
● Comprehensive case management is conducted in collaboration with formal institutions. This includes home visits 
for both new and ongoing cases, ensuring survivors receive counseling support and access to rehabilitation homes. 
14 children are currently on board in these counseling sessions. 
● Sometimes, monetary support through in kind resources are provided to survivors like school uniforms, books, etc.  
● Survivor collectives will be formed. 
● SHGs are not directly worked with. 
● There is not much work in the livelihood domain. 
Current MIS ● With a team of 8 animators, 1 project coordinator, and 1 MEL coordinator, SPMUS effectively facilitates the  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       28 
 
program on the ground. Comprehensive systems and various formats are established for data maintenance and 
reporting across operational areas. 
● Monthly plans guide animators in scheduling activities and home visits. Animators maintain daily diaries and later 
compile their data into multiple physical formats and registers. The MEL coordinator then digitizes this information 
into Excel sheets. 
● Key formats include attendance sheets, meeting minutes, home visit records, case management forms, dropout 
handling formats, SP documentation tracking, and case management physical registers. 
MPR Feedback ● The feedback on MPR is positive with no questions regarding the indicators.  
● They requested an activity level reporting format since the current MPR is only at the aggregated KPI level. 
● Case management workflows for them to keep track of follow-ups and current status of a case is also requested. 
● The addition of a remarks column was also raised. 
● Not comfortable with reporting 0s in the MPR. 
Capacity 
building 
● No such issue is faced in understanding indicators or definitions in MPR. 
 
2. Uttar Pradesh 
2.1 ROSA (Rural Organization for Social Advancement) 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● The organization is currently working in Balrampur district, focusing on two specific blocks. Within these blocks, 
they're working across 30 villages, collaborating with 26 Gram Panchayats. Since, the organizations’ geography has 
been changed hence it’s affecting their pace of work and achieving outcomes.  
● Till now they’ve spent most time and efforts in settling down in the new district and building rapport with the 
community. The team has completed the following activities within a period of 6 months:  
○ PRA and survey of households 
○ Rapport building with community  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       29 
 
○ Formation of community groups 
○ Liasoning with district-level line departments 
● One formation/reformation meeting has been conducted with all the groups including CPWCs and SMCs. 
○ 30 adolescent groups 
○ 30 parent groups 
○ 30 children’s groups  
○ 26 CWPCs 
○ 28 SMCs 
All the CWPCs and SMCs are currently not operational. 
● The organisation has also worked on creating safe corners in school for girls, training module formation on child 
protection for children’s groups, parents groups, training of govt officials and parents, campaigns on child marriage 
etc.  
● The organization doesn’t directly confront the community for case management, they go through a proper official 
channel to tackle such cases. 
● Since their field location in Balrampur is both a flood-prone area and a new geography for the team, the pace of 
work has been slower compared to other organizations in Uttar Pradesh. 
Current MIS ● The team has the following structure: Community Mobiliser -> Block Coordinator -> MIS manager -> Program 
Manager 
● They’ve divided the whole year work plan in following manner: Whole year plan -> Quarter wise -> Monthly plan -> 
Weekly (for CMs) -> weekly meetings 
● The current reporting structure involves a manual process. Field staff submits weekly plans (Form 1) and progress 
reports (Form 2) on paper. Block coordinators then manually gather this information and enter it into a monthly 
Excel spreadsheet. Finally, the MIS team and program manager take the information from the spreadsheets and 
format it according to the BAT's current reporting format. Additionally, they create a narrative report to provide 
further context. This multi-step, paper-based system can be time-consuming and prone to errors. 
● The current reporting structure takes approx. a week’s time at each level just to collate and report the information 
which is impacting their time and efforts to be used in the field.  
MPR Feedback ● The team shared that they liked the proposed MPR format which has given them a clear idea of what needs to be 
reported and when. 
● Though they were skeptical about the value their organization will get from this MPR. How will the work of the  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       30 
 
grassroots level team get effective and easier with this? 
● The team wanted to access the data after submission and receive feedback on the submitted report to make 
improvements and enhance their activities. 
● They want the addition of a comment section in front of indicators. 
● The team shared the concern of having numerous technical partners which reduces available time for community 
engagement. This can lead to delays in report completion, creating additional challenges for the team. 
Capacity 
building 
● The project team requires training of field team on technical aspects to make reporting time saving and easy for 
them 
● Most of the team members are above graduates and have experience of more than 3 years. They also have basic 
knowledge of computers.  
● Team members emphasized the importance of capacity building for community mobilizers in data analysis and 
interpretation. This will equip them to understand the data they collect, gain insights into their target populations, 
and effectively measure project achievements. 
 
2.2 MSEMVS (Manav Sansadhan Evam Mahila Vikas Sansthan) 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● The organization is currently working in Chandauli district, focusing on two specific blocks. Within these blocks, 
they're working across 50 villages and 37 gram panchayats, out of which 33 are their older villages where they 
worked previously with BAT.  
● In the previous phase, the work was focused on a few families at the panchayat level, but it has now expanded to 
include all families in the village. The advantage of continuing in the original geography is the established familiarity 
with stakeholders at the village and block levels, making liaison efforts more efficient. Additionally, 70% of the team 
members have been retained from the previous project, ensuring continuity and leveraging their existing 
experience and relationships. 
● From February to March 2024, a Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) was conducted, followed by a household 
survey and the formation of groups in April and May. In June 2024, capacity-building activities were carried out for 
these groups. A total of 7,083 families have been identified in the high and medium risk categories.  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       31 
 
● The team has established several key community groups within each village: a Community Vigilance Committee 
consisting of 30 members, Self-Help Groups (SHGs) with 10-15 members, a Children’s Forum for ages 6-14 with 
10-15 kids, and Youth Groups for those above 14 years with 10-12 members. 
● The team has identified two cases of child marriage and one case of child trafficking. Additionally, they have 
recognized 250 cases as being high risk. 
● With the community groups, their team has completed one formation meeting. Additionally, with the CPWCs and 
SMCs, they have conducted one reformation meeting and one training session. 
● During the field visit to one of their sites we could observe the kickstart of the work where they’ve appointed 
leaders for the community groups formed. 
Current MIS ● The team has the following structure: Community Mobiliser -> Program technical expert -> MIS manager -> 
Program Implementation lead -> Project Director 
● They have structured the entire year's work plan by dividing it into different levels: quarterly plans at the program 
lead level, monthly plans for the Block Technical Officer, and detailed monthly plans at the individual CM level, 
which include specific daily activities. 
● The current reporting structure involves multiple components: Village profile registers maintained by Community 
Mobilizers (CMs) capturing both Target Data and Achievement data. Google Forms are utilized for daily reporting 
on various aspects including Community Group Meetings, trainings, entitlements, case studies, livelihood 
assessments, and migration registers. All this information is compiled at the block level manual plus in excel sheets. 
Subsequently, an MIS person and program officer oversee the digitization process, transforming these data inputs 
into a cohesive final dashboard and comprehensive reports. 
● Case management registers are maintained at community mobilizer level. 
● Currently, the MIS process consumes about one week per month for both the Community Mobilizer and the Block 
Technical Person. Additionally, the MIS Person and Project Manager dedicate approximately 10 days each month 
to this task. 
MPR Feedback ● The team expressed appreciation for the proposed MPR format but are concerned regarding the compatibility 
between their existing MIS system and the proposed format. 
● The team wants the addition of a comment section alongside indicators to provide justification for numbers that 
are reported quarterly or under special circumstances. 
● They mentioned the addition of an indicator on the number of trainings of CPCs and SMCs, indicator for district 
level meetings for CPCs, SMCs and advocacy meetings.  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       32 
 
● The team raised concerns about the quarterly observation and reporting of indicators, as this may result in zero 
entries for certain indicators during some months. This could potentially demotivate the team and undermine the 
efforts made towards achieving the desired outputs and outcomes. 
Capacity 
building 
● They need capacity building to effectively capture and identify case stories for community mobilizers, technical 
training for ground staff on using technical tools, improved time management skills for efficient reporting, and 
comprehensive data management and storage training for community mobilizers. 
● Most of the team members at the CM level are graduates and have experience of more than 3 years. The people at 
block and head office levels are postgraduates with an average of 7 to 10 years of experience.  
 
2.3 PGS (Pragati Gramodyog Evam Samaj Kalyan Sansthan) 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● The organization is currently working in Prayagraj, focusing on two specific blocks. Within these blocks, they're 
working across 40 villages and 38 gram panchayats, out of which 24 are their older villages where they worked 
previously with BAT.  
● They also have the advantage of continuing in the original geography as they’ve established familiarity with 
stakeholders at the village and block levels, making liaison efforts more efficient. Additionally, all of their team 
members have been retained from the previous project, to ensure continuity and leveraging their existing 
experience and relationships. 
● Up to this point in the project timeline: In January and February 2024, training sessions facilitated by BAT were 
conducted. During March and April 2024, vulnerability mapping was completed for 11,000 households, identifying 
6,361 families categorized in red and 2,500 in yellow. In May and June 2024, efforts focused on establishing youth 
groups, adolescent groups, and reforming Self-Help Groups (SHGs), while raising awareness on school education, 
child labour, child protection, and substance abuse prevention. 
● The team has established several key community groups within each village: including forming 22 adolescent girl 
groups and 9 youth groups, revitalizing 138 Self-Help Groups (SHGs), and providing training to strengthen 58 
Village Level Child Protection Committees (VLCPCs). They have also conducted training for 38 School Management 
Committees (SMCs), with 18 now operational. Each village now has a tailored action plan, ensuring focused  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       33 
 
development efforts at the grassroots level. 
● The team has identified 35 survivors for livelihoods. 
Current MIS ● The team has the following structure: Community Mobiliser -> Program expert -> MIS manager -> Program officer 
● There is no clear division of the action plan with targets between team members, just a Gantt chart with monthly 
activity planning is shared within the team. 
● At the CM level, each activity requires a separate form, which is then compiled into a weekly report for discussion 
during meetings. This compilation and digitalization are handled by the program officer and MIS personnel. Notably, 
there is no compilation of information at the block level. 
● During the discussion, a critical gap was identified: the team failed to demonstrate how planning decisions cascaded 
down to the Community Mobilizer (CM) level and lacked documented evidence of target allocation. The current 
system centralizes data compilation at the MIS and Program Officer level, leaving CMs and block-level staff 
primarily responsible for gathering activity forms and forwarding them to the head office, which limits their 
awareness of their performance and achievements. 
MPR Feedback ● The team expressed appreciation for the proposed MPR format but are concerned how they’ll report the numbers 
since their current reporting structure doesn’t collect all those numbers at the ground. 
● The team wants the addition of a comment section alongside indicators to provide justification for numbers that are 
reported quarterly or under special circumstances. 
● They want to have a format for ground level reporting. 
Capacity 
building 
● The organization requires capacity building to enhance the technical skills of its team and to develop a robust 
Management Information System (MIS) within the organization.

Theme Narrative  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       34 
 
Program 
Activities 
● The organization started with working on land rights and then moved to work on livelihoods and education. On child 
protection, they first worked on reintegration of survivors but now the focus has shifted to education.  
● Under BAT, they work as a technical partner for livelihoods (for economic resilience) in Bihar and on reintegration as 
well. However, the reintegration work is being phased out and will end in December. 
● At present, they are working with 148 families across 4 districts. They conducted a scoping study in the beginning to 
identify problems. They understood that working on vegetable farming yields good income for the families hence 
decided to work on that. They do not give seed money directly but support farmers by giving actual vegetable seeds 
(of okra, cauliflower, bottle gourd etc.). They have given seeds to 250 families, of which 148 families would be 
supported till the end of the project. For the landless, they promote mushroom cultivation and goat rearing.        
● They connect 18+ youth to skill development plans (vocational courses such as training in automobile repairs, as 
electricians and on soft skills etc) and offer employment support as well.  
● At present, they are training farmers directly on the field but in the next phase, they will start training partners as 
well.  
● They also connect families to social protection schemes for livelihoods like MGNREGA, PM Samman etc 
● They promote farmer interest groups. Working on financial literacy is also in our plan.    
Current MIS ● Since the last 6-7 months, they have been using an application called inbuilt for reporting and monitoring their work. 
The application captures location of staff and enables them to share updates of the work done and real-time pictures 
from the field. They work according to their weekly plans.  
● They have a small team but the team is proficient in using Kobo toolbox for monitoring. They have an MIS person 
whose job is to verify the data sent via random field visits and official records.     
MPR Feedback ● Overall, they are happy with the format shared at the outcome level.  
● Given that the MPR might not be relevant for them being a technical partner, but they wish to report the work that 
they are doing with the survivors in the MPR.  
● Would be better if we could report in a narrative format (along with the numbers) as it helps capture 
stories/pathways of progress.   
Capacity 
building 
● Indicators are largely self-explanatory; minimal amount of capacity building support required.

3.2 BMVS 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● They work in 10 villages of Jale block of Darbhanga district.  
● In education, they work on strengthening SMCs/ward level CPCs, youth groups of girls aged 6-14 and 14-18, 
running bridge courses for imparting basic literacy and life skills, making schools safe (by getting schools to have a 
child protection policy in place), liasoning with education officials at block/district level, facilitate meeting between 
such officials and the community and running awareness campaigns for re-enrollment of dropouts, on social 
protection schemes and livelihoods. Facilitation of enrollment is out of the scope of work of the organization.  
● For child protection cases, issues are identified mainly through youth groups. Then these are referred to the CPC (by 
the community mobiliser) post which the parents of the potential victim are spoken to/counseled. Youth groups 
counsel the potential victims. The entire process takes up to a week. All actions are undertaken by the community 
while being facilitated by BMVS.   
● The organisation stopped 12 cases of child marriage in the last 6 months.  
● CPCs were reinstated by March 2024 and half of all CPCs have had meetings till now. About 8 SMC trainings have 
been conducted till now.    
● They don’t work much on survivor collectives or survivors in general.  
Current MIS ● Have a staff of 6 people for implementation and reporting.  
● They had a quarterly reporting format for previous funders while they would collect data at an organizational level 
monthly.  
● Data is collected manually from the field, while a coordinator/MIS person compiles the same before reporting. Data 
is also verified through reports obtained from the community resource centers or schools.   
● The MIS person works out of the field office in Jale and comes to Muzaffarpur once a week.  
MPR Feedback ● Difficult for the team to comprehend and use the MPR (was not able to locate the drop-down list on the cover page). 
They’ve used a google-form based reporting format before and it was easier for them to use it as compared to the 
MPR.  
● Difficult to get data on dropouts, irregular attendance. No school will provide this information.  
● In Bihar (and the areas that they work in), bridge courses are run by NGOs. Remedial classes were offered by school, 
but they’ve stopped for years now. Of the children attending bridge courses, only a few re-enroll in schools - the  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       36 
 
indicators related to bridge courses need to change in the MPR to suit the context of Bihar.   
Capacity 
building 
● Require in-person training on MPR (especially for the MIS person). Did not find online training that useful.  
● Require training on the MPR for the field team as well as they are the ones who will get the data.  
● Need to understand the mechanisms for getting data and the means of verification required.  
● Need clarifications of definitions of certain indicators like multi-stakeholders, reporting and prevention of cases etc. 
and understanding the interconnections between the indicators.   
 
3.3 Tatvasi Samaj Nyas (TSN) 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● Started work in 2004 in 5 districts. Initially, their work focused on rescue and rehabilitation of survivors but now the 
focus has shifted to child protection.  
● Their work on rehabilitation (which includes linking the survivors to compensation packages, providing legal aid, 
facilitating social protection schemes for families and re-enrolling in schools) will be slowly phased out by December.  
● The geographical focus of the BAT project is on 30 wards in 10 villages of 5 panchayats in Azamnagar block of 
Katihar district in Bihar. All the areas chosen under the BAT project are new.    
● They informed that of the 117 children rescued from Jaipur last year, about 87 were from Azamnagar block. They 
were able to provide full compensation to 11 survivors last year. 2 child marriages were stopped recently.  
● In education, their work involves strengthening SMCs/W-CPCs, monitoring and re-enrolling dropouts, and 
conducting bridge courses. They conduct enrollment drives, help children with applications, open bank accounts, and 
follow up on them once the admissions are done.  
●  In livelihoods, they mainly work on facilitating microloans through MFIs and Jeevika. SSEVS has trained and 
provided vegetable seeds to the farmers in farming techniques, but the effort got wasted due to the flood situation 
in the area.    
● They have formed and work with a survivor collective called Pragati for survivors of child labour. They work to build 
confidence of the survivors so they can create awareness on the issue in the community, connect them with DLSA 
and DM and educate them on their rights and entitlements  
● They’ve formed community vigilance committees (CVCs) of people aged 18 to 45 (of which 50% are women) to  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       37 
 
identify traffickers. Youth and adolescent groups have also been formed.  
Current MIS ● Have a team of 6 people in Azamnagar block for project execution and management. Have 2 block coordinators and 
2 frontline workers for the 5 GPs.  
● Data is collected by all people in the organization depending on the level of data collection. Both - the number of 
activities conducted, and number of people reached are reported.  
● Data collection is manual and then collated and entered in excel once a month. They have a ‘Dainik Prativedan’ form 
for recording everyday’ s work. A logbook is used for recording the field staff’s travel. All staff work according to an 
individual work plan prepared for a month.    
MPR Feedback ● TSN enrolls children under 6 years in their bridge courses and wants to report their numbers as well in the MPR.  
● Schools used to provide remedial education, but this has stopped since 2016. The remedial education indicator might 
not be relevant given this context.   
● Very difficult to get data on dropouts, irregular attendance (schools will not share such data).   
● Have not had a good experience with previous technical partners for MEL. Hence, expect the MPR and the entire 
reporting process to be as simple as possible now.  They’ve also conducted rallies advocating for building 
infrastructure for schools.  
● Foresee challenges in evidence-based reporting for most indicators. Data will be collected but getting proof of 
authenticity of the same might prove to be an issue. Some stakeholders will give information while some may not.   
Capacity 
building 
● Require a point-of-contact from the MEL team who they can take support from whenever required.  
● Have a large understood the indicators but require sufficient training on the MPR in order to understand the 
language clearly.   
 
3.4 Adithi 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● Started in 1988 with a focus on working for women’s issues and organizational development.  
● Under BAT, they work in 2 blocks - Sonbarsa and Parihar - 10 panchayats, 25 villages and 75 wards.  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       38 
 
● They work on child protection at the village, ward, GP, block and district levels. They work on capacity building of 
para-legal volunteers at the village level, CPCs, youth groups (meena manch, bal sansad) at ward level, PRI members 
and SMCs at GP level, B-CPC/police at the block level, and liasoning with DLSA at district level with the aim of 
making child protection committees functional and accountable. They work with the education department at the 
block level to train and sensitize them to work on RTE issues and child-friendly policies. They also work to facilitate 
the uptake of social protection schemes (e.g. connecting them with Jeevika for loans).  
● Informers within the youth groups help them identify child protection cases.   
● They have 2 community mobilisers to look after 5 villages each. 
● For dropouts, the ward-level groups identify them, the organization gets the children re-enrolled in schools, and 
monitors them once the admission is done.  They run bridge courses for dropouts/ never enrolled and tuitions for 
class 9/10 students (this work has only started since April 2024). They support the government in running 
enrollment campaigns. They also facilitate linkages to vocational courses (but only those run by the government). 
● They also have a survivor collective called ‘Aagaz Sangathan’.  
● Under BAT, 80% of the villages chosen are new while in the remaining 20%, they’ve been working since last year.    
● They work collaboratively with SSEVS who has distributed vegetable seeds to selected families and has trained the 
partner staff and farmers on farming techniques. The organization requires a lot of support and handholding to work 
on livelihoods.  
Current MIS ● They report their work done based on activities conducted - the number of training/activities done, and the number 
of people reached is what is reported.  
● Data collection, monitoring and reporting is a collaborative process. While the community mobiliser collects data 
manually from the field, the program coordinator validates it and then the data is sent to the program 
implementation officer for her review before being sent to the funder. An MIS person (along with a program staff) is 
available for digitizing the manually collected data.  
● Previously, they have also developed and used monitoring formats for monitoring work done by SMCs.     
MPR Feedback ● The numbers asked for reporting are quite detailed. Require support to know which sources of information should 
be considered (where will the data come from?) 
● Schools/block resource centers do not have data on dropouts. So, it is very difficult to get information on the 
indicators for dropouts/irregular attendance. SMCs might collect/monitor the status of dropouts, but it is difficult to 
check its authenticity. Would be better if they had a format for monitoring of SMCs.   
● Very few schools ran remedial classes last summer but largely schools do not run any bridge or remedial education  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       39 
 
classes. Indicators pertaining to this issue need to be tweaked to align with the context of Bihar.  
● Columns for remarks should be added for all indicators so they can share all the qualitative remarks along with the 
numbers.      
● Not clear what ‘knowledge events’ mean.  
● For the indicator on training of stakeholders for education, Police/DLSA will not be applicable.  
Capacity 
building 
● Need support on better understanding the indicators. Language becomes a constraint in understanding indicator 
definitions.  
● Require training support for the field staff as well as they are the ones collecting the data.  
 
3.5 Centre Direct 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● Under the BAT project, CD works in 2 blocks namely Chandauti and Khizersarai of Gaya district. In Chanduati, they 
work in 9 GPs, 15 villages and 45 wards whereas in Khizersarai, they work in 9 GPs, 10 villages and 30 wards.  
● They work mainly on strengthening committees aimed at child protection such as youth, adolescent, children’s 
groups (formed by CD) and School management committees, and child protection committees at ward, GP, block and 
district level (formed by the govt). 
● SSEVS works on livelihoods in their area. They’ve provided seeds to farmers (farming on leased land) of 2 villages in 
Chandauti block for growing vegetables. Another organization called Kheti has provided poly house and greenhouse 
support to farmers in their area.  
● In 10 villages, they’ve started 10 bridge course centers for dropouts, with each center catering to about 30 students. 
The course - for children aged 6 to 14 years - runs for 6 months. Tutors record attendance of students and submit to 
them monthly. On completion of the bridge course, interested students are linked to schools.   
● Remedial classes have been newly introduced in Bihar.  
● They also connect survivors to vocational training courses however they face challenges in doing so given that 
enrollment in vocational courses requires the candidates to have studied till class 8th.  
● They work with Child welfare committees (at the district level). Child protection cases are reported to the CWC at 
present as CPCs are not strengthened yet.   
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       40 
 
● Due to CDs efforts, for the 1st time, about 15.5 lakhs were allotted for child protection in the GPDP budget of 
certain villages in Gaya district. 
● Work also involves liasoning with officials working on child protection at the district level - this at times gets difficult 
due to frequent transfer of government officials.  
Current MIS ● They have a total staff of 16 people.  
● Field staff sends daily work updates on WhatsApp and on google forms. Once every month, a meeting is held at the 
office to validate the work and the data. Actual work is tracked against the plan.   
● About 8 panchayat facilitators collect data manually at the ward level and report the same to the block coordinator 
at the district level. Some data is collected directly by the block coordinator as well. Block coordinator reports data 
to the CD office at the district level.   
MPR Feedback ● Challenging to get data on number of dropouts or irregular students. Mostly, schools will not share such data.  
● Would be helpful if they knew which sources of data can be used for collecting data for the MPR and the means of 
verification that can be used.   
● Would be helpful if they got data compiled at a village-level (at least every 6 months).   
● Full forms of abbreviations should be there (e.g. WASH) as it might be clear to everyone.  
● On SMCs, the indicator should be school-level committees strengthened, and not created as these committees 
already exist and they only work to strengthen them.  
● Would have preferred to have activity-based reporting as our work is more visible then.  
Capacity 
building 
● Need support in understanding some indicators such as functional CPCs and frequency of reporting as data for many 
indicators won’t change monthly.  
 
4. Rajasthan:  
Rajasthan state has a unique context for the COF-KAWACH program, in comparison to the other three target states. The program has been 
implemented in the urban context of Jaipur district. All partners are familiar with the geography since the same partners have been working for a  
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       41 
 
long period and continuing the work from the previous engagements. However, the approach towards child protection is shifting from rescue to 
preventive with resilience building as a focus area1.  
 
4.1 Pardarshita 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● Pardarshita’s larger focus has been on education and pedagogy to ensure improvement in learning outcomes.  
● Currently, they are working across 22 wards and 8 areas through 8 Learning Resource Centers (LRCs) 
● They also work with CCP and engage with 50 SMCs to strengthen them. Strengthened SMC will ensure reduction in 
dropouts and support in identification of any child exploitation cases.  
● Pardarshita engages with youth and children collectives (Child Parliament) for identification of potential dropouts 
and child protection issues.  
● Through learning they provide a platform to bridge the learning gains and ensure new or re enrollment into 
appropriate school levels.  
● To facilitate the enrollment and admissions, they also help with social protection entitlement related documents.  
● They are also working with CCP for Safe school initiative in 9 schools out of 50 schools.  
Current MIS ● Pardarshita has an excel based MIS where they track their activities 
● Learning center admissions and school admissions get tracked at the individual level.  
● Social entitlements are also getting tracked at the individual level. Details of social entitlements are not fully 
captured.  
● However, these systems exist at the LRC level and MIS officers collate everything manually from all files at the 
central level.  
● SMC gets tracked by 16 program officers operating across 8 areas/8 LRCs. These officers can track 16 SMC 
meetings monthly; whereas the rest of the SMC gets tracked through pictures shared over WhatsApp through 
volunteers or Children Groups.  
MPR Feedback ● The current version of the MPR helps in comprehensively capturing the program outcomes.  
 
1 Partners like Taabar continue to engage in the same way   
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       42 
 
● Identification of cases through NGO can be added as an option in the format since Pardarshita staff also identifies 
various child exploitation cases due to their close engagement with communities.  
● SMC wise activities related to functional and operational can be captured - following the old format of MPR that 
they used to report. That helps in managing the SMC strengthening well.  
● Remarks columns for each indicator can be added since narrative for each outcome is also crucial. Numbers may not 
be able to effectively demonstrate efforts being put in to achieve the outcomes.  
● They also requested to understand the effectiveness and fidelity of the processes being implemented. They would 
want to learn and understand which process has been the most effective.  
Capacity 
building 
● They do have dedicated resources for MIS and program activities. Hand Holding on the format will help them.  
● Tools to capture activity level interactions and follow up the same institution/individual would help in making 
reporting smoother.  
 
4.2 Access Development Services 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● Under the COF-KAWACH project, Access continues to work with 60 SHGs and around 850 women members to 
provide employment through Producer Company (PC). They are using economic empowerment as a lever for 
resilience building.  
● Access’s larger focus has been building capacities of women through life skills and business skills training to ensure 
that they are able to participate in the value chain activities for crafts. They facilitate training and exposure sessions 
for producer company members to understand the market and engage with customers.  
● Access provides access to various social security entitlements to women members; supporting in preparing relevant 
documents and also renewing some of the old entitlements as well.  
● Access links PC women to banks as well to facilitate micro loans and seed money (non-returnable) from NULM.  
● Access ensures that children of SHG and producer company women dont engage into child labour and also attend 
schools regularly. Access conducts random visits to member houses to monitor and report the same.  
Current MIS ● Access has a robust monitoring system that tracks all activities across the program.   
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       43 
 
● They are tracking all SHGs and provide management support. Availability of funds, minutes of meetings and 
functioning of SHGs are ensured through regular monitoring.  
● They also track employment and wages for each PC member regularly.  
● Training sessions and attendance of women gets tracked at the individual level.  
● Social protection for women members gets tracked at the individual level.  
● Currently, Access does not track or report the educational status of SHG women’s children that they monitor 
through random spot visits.  
MPR Feedback ● The shared MPR format is more intuitive and helps us understand what needs to be captured.  
● The current format of the MPR does not capture business aspects of the Producer company comprehensively.  
● They would want to see the progress against the target set out in the LFA that is agreed with BAT more seamlessly 
through a technology tool.  
Capacity 
building 
● The Access team is competent and aware of current MIS tools and programs thoroughly.  
● The capacity building will focus on training on the activity-based MIS and ensuring that all activities get captured. 
 
 
4.3 SEWA 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● SEWA has been operating in Rajasthan state across multiple clusters for over a decade. Operations in Jaipur are also 
a little over 4-5 years old and they are working with 75 SHGs; of which 69 SHGs are active currently.  
● SEWA largely focuses on empowering women by imparting life skills in women and helping them engage into value 
generation activities. Their focus is on women empowerment through capacity building and not business activities.  
● SEWA monitors the functioning of SHGs regularly and provides support whenever necessary.  
● Their focus is also on financial literacy programs and linking SHG women to banks. In the process, they also facilitate 
social protection schemes for these women members.  
● They also support SHG women’s children for education through learning centers to bridge the gap for new or re-
enrollment.   
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       44 
 
Current MIS ● SEWA has been working with SHGs for quite some time and the systems put in place are rudimentary in nature.  
● All data related to education (enrollment/admission, learning center) gets tracked at the individual level 
● Social protection data formats are basic and need further nuance. Currently, they capture only member names and 
documents. Scheme names etc. are not being captured.  
● Like Access, training sessions and attendance of women gets tracked at the individual level.  
MPR Feedback ● The current MPR format helps them understand the processes and what is expected for reporting.  
● All fields are not applicable for SEWA, and they would want to capture more activities to showcase the efforts being 
put in.  
Capacity 
building 
● The training will be required to build perspectives on the value of comprehensive MIS systems capturing activities.  
● The staff of SEWA is not well versed with technology tools, and they may require more intensive hand holding.  
 
 
4.4 LEDS 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● LEDS’s work focuses on the migrant population and single women. They work with them to provide social 
entitlements and education to their children.  
● They provide bridge learning through 5 LRCs and work with 9 schools in 2 areas.  
● They provide courses and entitlements support for pre-schooling age of 3-6 years to enable enrollment into 
schools.   
● They form a child parliament and action research group composed of fellows that help in identification of child 
exploitation issues and dropouts.  
● LEDS will be phasing out of the program from next year.  
Current MIS ● The MIS is very basic, and it captures the data at the LRC level for attendance.  
● LRC also has details on enrollment/admission for dropouts of children. 
● Social entitlements of the individual get tracked at the aggregated level.   
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       45 
 
MPR Feedback ● The language of the MPR is not clear; having MPR in Hindi would be beneficial.  
● Certain output reporting can be arranged in alignment with the themes. Suggested to shift convergence activities 
from 'Livelihoods' tab to 'Groups' tab.  
Capacity 
building 
● LEDS will require a deep handholding for activity-based MIS, since they are used to track aggregated output 
numbers.  
● The training will be required to build perspectives on the value of comprehensive MIS systems capturing activities.  
● The staff of LEDS is not well versed with technology tools and they may require more intensive hand holding.  
 
4.5 Centre for Child Protection (CCP) 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● Center for Child Protection is a government-aided institution working mainly on system strengthening work.  
● They work with the government departments to release various directives focusing on resource allocations for SMC 
strengthening, formation of CPCs, and conducting convergence activities 
● They provide support to other program partners in engaging with the government (Pardarshita for SMC 
strengthening, safe school initiatives etc.; LEDS for admissions in primary schools).  
● They also conduct capacity building sessions to share the best practices, orient them on various child protection 
related laws and help in framing right articles and sections for each child protection case.  
Current MIS ● CCP has a robust MIS system to capture all activities. All capacity building sessions are captured for attendance  
● They also maintain a case management for all children and work with CWC  
● Their counseling sessions are also getting tracked for participation 
MPR Feedback ● The MPR format doesn't capture their efforts at all since the work is very focused on system strengthening which 
has a higher gestation period for outcome realisation.  
● BAT will share a separate format for technical partners. 
● A format that tracks activities need to be captured for each engagement and liasoning with the government.   
 
 
 
Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       46 
 
Capacity 
building 
● Capacity building would be needed to ensure uptake of the tech-based tool in the future.  
 
4.6 Taabar 
Theme Narrative 
Program 
Activities 
● Taabar engages in providing post rescue support for reintegration of boys and children.  
● This is provided in batches to ensure full comprehensive support starting from medical checkups, dealing with the 
government for FIR and other legal support, nutritional support, counseling etc.  
● Support for 1 batch lasts for 4-5 months. And they run 2 batches- each of 40-50 at any point in time.   
● They also build capacities for the government departments- labour departments, CWCs and DCPUs.  
Current MIS ● Currently, Taabar manages their operations through a batch register and ensures case management of each child.  
● They also capture details on the capacity building of the government departments. 
MPR Feedback ● The MPR format doesn't capture their efforts since the work is very focused on the case management and provides 
all relevant support. 
● BAT will share a separate format for technical partners. 
● A format that tracks activities needs to be captured for each follow up and track status changes over time.  
Capacity 
building 
● Training for Taabar would be on the case management tool or the MIS to be set up. However, a minimum effort will

Toaddressthesechallenges, COF-KAWACH, a10-yearchildprotectioninitiativebyBATandotherpartners,waslaunchedinJune2022.Theinitiativeaimstobuildandstrengthensystemsfromgrassrootstostatelevels,preventingvulnerablechildrenfromcyclesofexploitation.
During the one-year gating period, the COF-KAWACH prevention model will be piloted,reaching 300,000 households across 393villagesandgramsansadsinBihar, Uttar Pradesh,West Bengal, and Rajasthan. The programinvolves working with local organisations andgovernment bodiestoenhancechildprotectionmeasuresandalignswiththeGovernmentofIndia's“MissionVatsalya”initiative.
Implementationwill behandledbyNGOpartnersat ﬁeld, district, andstatelevels,withBAToverseeing monitoring and management. Currently, 20 partners operate in four states. Arobust monitoring and evaluation systemwill be deployed providing regular and accurateinformation on the initiative's implementation, enabling effective programmonitoring andmanagement.
By focusing on these comprehensive andinterconnectedstrategies, COF-KAWACHaimstocreate sustainable improvements in child protection systems, ultimately leading to saferenvironmentsandbetteroutcomesforchildren.
TheCatalyst Management Services(CMS) team, astheMonitoring, Evaluation,andLearning(MEL) partner in this engagement, has compiled this inception report based on ﬁeld visits,thoroughdocument reviews,andongoingcommunicationwiththeprogramteamanddonors.This report outlines the MEL approach including the high level indicators, MIS, learningframework and mechanismand the capacity building schedule of partners. This is set toestablish the foundation for the successful implementation of the MEL system for theCOF-KAWACHinitiative.

3.1 MonitoringandEvaluationApproach
3.1.1 TheoryofChange
InlinewiththemissionofCOF-KAWACHprogramtotapintoexistingsystemsandcreatesystemicshiftsforchildprotectionbypromotingchild-centric,evidence-backed,preventivemodelsandstrategies,aTheoryofChangehasbeendevelopedbyDalberginconsultationwith BAT and other key stakeholders. The Theory of Change takes a “prevention ﬁrst”approach, focusing on the underlying drivers of family and child vulnerability, such aspoverty,socialnorms,andweakchildprotectionstructures.Thegoalistoensurethatthereisadecreaseinprevalenceofchildlabour,childmarriage,childtrafﬁckingandchildsexualabuse.
Toachievethesesystemicshifts,COF-Kawachisstructuredaroundthreestrategicpillars:
1. Implement holistic and preventive approaches that build familyandcommunityresilienceandstrengthensystemsforchildren.2. Prevent and deter onlineabuseandexploitationof children, aswell asmitigaterisksfromotheremergingthreats.3. Strengthen the child protection ecosystem through data, evidence, and multistakeholdercollaboration.
Amongthesepillars,theﬁrstoneencompassesthelargestnumberofoperationsongroundas it isaprimaryobjectiveduringthegatingperiod. Hence, theproposedMELapproachfocuses on the ﬁrst pillar of the Theoryof change. Thesestrategicprioritiesarefurtherdelineatedintothemesandsubthemestoprovideaclearerunderstandingofhowtheywillbeoperationalized.Eachsubthemeisassociatedwithspeciﬁcactivitiesthatalignwiththeoverarchinggoals.
Tomeasureoutcomes, alist of indicators- CascadetoImpact indicators(C2I) havebeencreated by BAT and its partners that are in line with the programobjectives. Theseindicators represent the ultimategoalsthat theprogramaimstoachieveandcontributetowards short/medium term outcomes laying the pathway for developing a holisticecosystemfor child protection in India. To ensure progress towards these outcomes, aseries of interim KPIs have been created which will help track progress throughoutdifferent stages of implementation, providing measurable checkpoints that guide theprogramtowardsitsﬁnalgoals.

Design
The design of the tech-enabled Management Information System(MIS) formats will beachievedthroughastructuredprocessthatbeginswithanin-depthreviewoftheprogram’sTheory of Change (ToC), outlining the strategic vision, goals, and outcomes of theCOF-KAWACH initiative. An assessment of the C2I indicators to set benchmarks formeasuring success and identify speciﬁc KPIs within each C2I will be conducted incollaborationwiththeBATteamtoalignwiththepartnerleveloperationalplans.Followingthis,wewillmaptheactualground-levelactivities,detailingspeciﬁcactions,interventions,andprocessesundertakenbypartnersintheﬁeld.Someofthesewillbecontextualisedandderived fromthe landscaping ﬁeld visits. This systematic approach ensures a coherentframeworkfortheMISdesign,enablingaccuratedatacaptureandmonitoring,whichinturnfacilitateslearning,trackingprogress,andstrategicdecision-making.
Structure
TheMISwill bebuilt tocapturedatainthethematicareasofEducation,Livelihoods,andSocial Protection cutting across layers starting from a child, family/household, andcommunity groups at the ﬁeld level totheblock, withtheoverarchingobjectiveof childprotection. Capturing granular data will ensure that information on relevant activitiestaking place on the ground is taken account of, providing a foundation for higher levelanalysis andreporting. Hence, theMISsystemwill support ﬁeldcoordinatorsintracking

3.1.5 Qualityassurancemechanism
Arobust quality assurance mechanismis essential for theMELsystemtomaintainhighstandardsofdatacollection,processing,andreporting.Thismechanismwillincludearangeof procedures and controls designed to verify data accuracy, ensure consistency, andpreventerrorsthroughoutthedatalifecycle.
SystemProtocols
○ Rules and Constraints within MIS: TheMISwill bedesignedwithbuilt-inrulesandconstraints to prevent data entry errors and ensure logical consistency. Theseincludemandatoryﬁelds,predeﬁnedinputranges,andformatvalidationsthatguideuserstoinputdatacorrectly.○ Triangulation Based on Indicators: To validate the data collected, triangulationmethodswillbeemployed,whichinvolvecross-verifyinginformationfrommultipleindicators.○ Periodic Exception Reports with Identiﬁed Anomalies and Flags: The system willgenerate periodic exception reports that will highlight any anomalies orirregularitiesinthedata. Thesereportsshouldautomaticallyﬂagdatapointsthatdeviate from expected patterns, allowing us to quickly identify and addresspotentialissues.
ConcurrentQAandValidation
○ Month wise Field Visits for 20% of the Partners: Each month, ﬁeld visits will beconductedfor 20%of thepartnerstovalidatethedatareportedintheMIS.Thesevisits involve on-site veriﬁcation of records, interviews with staff, and directobservationof activities.

Furthermore, partners will certify theinformationprovided,especiallyforinformationonacertainsubjectiveKPIs.○ Trigger-Based QA: Trigger-based quality assurance is a responsive mechanismactivated when data anomalies are detected. If a sudden irregularity or unusualpatternisidentiﬁedinthedata,itwilltriggeranimmediateQAreview.
3.1.6 Establishingconcurrentlearningsynthesismechanism
With the intent of assessing the progress towards ensuring the ﬁdelity, quality, andeffectivenessof theimplementationoftheKAWACHprogram,aconcurrentevaluationofthe programprocess to establishlearningsynthesismechanismwouldbeundertakensothat the aspects of the program which are driving the achievement of outputs andoutcomes, giventhesocioeconomicandcultural context of theprogramlocations,canbeappropriatelyinferred.
Framework
Considering that the mandate of the gating period is to focus on developing robustimplementationandMELmechanismsfor scalingoftheprogrampostthegatingperiod,aMELframeworkthatiswell-suitedtomeetthecorelearningobjectivesofthegatingperiodneeds tobeused.

A strong child protection system is critical in ensuring that children are protected from all forms of violence, abuse, 
and exploitation. However, implementing a comprehensive and accessible children’s protection system is riddled 
with a myriad of challenges. The key challenge is the very nature of child protection violations, often shrouded in 
stigma and hidden from public view.
British Asia Trust (BAT) is committed to keeping children safe from all forms of violence, abuse, and exploitation. 
With an ambitious vision to achieve a 30% reduction in child labour, child trafficking, child marriage, and commercial 
sexual exploitation of children, as well as a 50% reduction in online child sexual abuse and exploitation, specifically 
in the states where these crimes against children are most prevalent, BAT has launched the KAWACH programs 
(Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Rajasthan). The program seeks to transform the child protection system 
in the country by constructing a comprehensive prevention model to establish a secure ecosystem, mitigate 
vulnerabilities, and bolster the prosecution of traffickers and exploiters. This pioneering model of prevention and 
protection strategies will honour the need to nurture the child protection ecosystem through data, evidence, and 
multi-stakeholder collaboration to prevent online abuse, exploitation, and emerging threats that endanger children. 
To provide the foundational data and set pre intervention benchmark for key indicators, Athena Infonomics carried 
out the Baseline Study in these 5 States covering 16 focused Districts. The study aims to gain a deep understanding 
of the scope and breadth of the protection concerns of children, including the prevalence, knowledge, attitudes, 
and factors that affect child tye key protection issues in the country. It also recognizes children as an active agent 
with rights and explores children’s agency and decision-making capacity on child protection issues. Generating 
good data is crucial to promoting evidence-informed programming that tells us what the issues are, where they 
are and how best to tackle them. 
The research process was crucial to identify and build relationships with stakeholders, including community 
stakeholders, judicial representatives, government agencies, caregivers and children at all levels, so that these 
concerns are addressed systematically, and a coalition is built to support the strategies identified. This baseline 
study also provides an overview of the institutional challenges, including gaps in legal frameworks, and capacity 
gaps in support provided by the government, NGOs, and community institutions such as the Gram Panchayats, 
School Management Committees, and the Village Child Protection Committees.
A number of recommendations for addressing the issues are highlighted by the research. I am optimistic that in 
our effort to formulate interventions, these findings will be utilized effectively to guide the implementation of 
programs. This is an urgent matter for us in the BAT– to create a safer environment for our children. It is critical 
that together, we ensure the protection of our children by strengthening prevention strategies, supporting 
effective implementation of the laws and policies that protect them.  
This report is just a beginning. We hope that the momentum generated through this report and the Kwach 
initiative will continue to build a strong child protection ecosystem in India.

This baseline report is a result of seven months of consultative and collaborative process, rooted in a robust 
methodology supported by rigorous methods and techniques throughout the data collection and analysis process.
The baseline evaluation required the coordinated efforts of many people. Many individuals, institutions, and 
groups have assisted and provided input in carrying out this baseline study and without their support, the study 
would not have been possible. Thank you to all individuals and organisations who agreed to be consulted for the 
study, for their time, patience, and openness. Special thanks are extended to the 6560+ children and mothers who 
graciously gave their time, knowledge, and energy by talking to the research team and sharing their beliefs and 
experiences on the care and protection of children. Without this participation and commitment to strengthening 
child protection, the baseline study would not have been possible. 
This meaningful research was made possible with the vision and resources of British Asia Trust. Athena extends 
its appreciation to Shireen Vakil, Karan Malik, Mrinmoy Sarkar, Rohan Singh, Pooja Kandula & Richa Tigga for their 
technical guidance and input into sampling, comments on questionnaire drafts, valuable comments on this report

• In India, the realm of child protection confronts intricate challenges, substantiated by recent data illustrating 
a disconcerting escalation in child abuse cases. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the 
incidence of crimes against children surged from 28.9 per lakh children in 2020 to 33.6 in 2021.1 
• NCRB findings indicate a 20% increase in cases of child trafficking and exploitation, along with a 16% rise in 
sexual abuse or crimes against children in the preceding year. With developments in technology children have 
become vulnerable to abuse through digital mediums. A global survey, 54 per cent of the young population 
reported having experienced online sexual harm before they were 18 years old.2 
• The British Asian Trust has introduced the KAWACH initiative, targeting a substantial reduction in child labor, 
trafficking, marriage, and online abuse over the next decade in specific high-prevalence states. 
• To gauge the current child protection landscape, this baseline study was carried out to assess prevalence, 
vulnerabilities, and stakeholder knowledge at the district level, establishing baseline values for monitoring 
progress and identifying crucial stakeholders in the fight against child exploitation. 
• The study covered 5 issues focused by the KAWACH initiatives: Child Marriage, Child Labor, Child Trafficking, 
Child Sexual Abuse (CSA), and Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (OCSAE).
• The study covered a survey sample of 6560 mothers and 6560 children (aged 13-18 years) from 160 villages 
equal distributed between 16 districts of the 4 focused states: West Bengal, Bihar, Rajasthan and Uttar 
Pradesh. In addition, 164 qualitative interactions were done with key stakeholders from government and 
community representatives. 
• Given the hidden nature of these issues, Network Scale-Up Method (N-SUM) was used for measuring the prevalence.3 
• The findings show 13.9% of mothers have witnessed at least one incident of child marriage, with Murshidabad 
district in West Bengal reporting the highest incidence at 66.2%. Based on N-SUM estimates, the average 
rate of child marriage per district was estimated at 19.4%, with Darbanga having the highest rate at 35.6%. 
• 2.6% of mothers have witnessed at least one incident of child labor, with Murshidabad district in West Bengal 
reporting the highest incidence at 20.2%. While more than 20% of the children were working in family settings/
household settings across. Incident of child labor was faced primarily by boys with average prevalence for 
boys was 18% as compared to 0.9% for girls.
•  Among the 160 villages surveyed, 91 reported witnessing at least one case of child marriage and 38 villages 
reported witnessing at least one case of child labor.
• Reasons cited for early marriage include the fear of eloping or engaging in an affair at a young age. While child 
labor was attributed to poverty and economic struggle.

• In areas with low reported prevalence, stakeholders attribute success to ongoing awareness campaigns by 
government departments and NGOs, active reporting, and other key initiatives in eliminating child marriage.
• Overall, children showed better knowledge and attitude on indicators associated with early marriage, 
while mothers reported poor knowledge and attitude levels. Similarly, children showed comprehensive 
understanding of the detrimental effects of child labor during qualitative interactions but underscore a 
thorough understanding on the significance of reporting child labor. 
• Overall reporting on witnessing issues of trafficking, sexual abuse, and online child sexual abuse & exploitation 
(OCSAE) was very low. 
• Some of the potential reasons for low reporting of these issues include poor understand of the issues and its 
identification, fear and shame associated with the issue, legal formalities associated, cultural norms and practices etc. 
• Qualitative findings report challenges in identifying victims and the hidden nature of the problem makes it 
difficult to gain an accurate picture of the trends and prevalence of child trafficking.
•  It was also revealed that trafficking is often confused as child labor, making the issue hard to recognize. 
Knowledge related to child trafficking was also low among children with only 40.7% reported receiving any 
information on child trafficking. 
• Qualitative findings indicated children getting confused between child labor and trafficking. Illiteracy, poverty, 
and unemployment were reported as the main factors for child trafficking though some variation in factors 
emerged across states. 
• In case of sexual abuse, contradicting picture on the prevalence of child sexual abuse, whether the cases are 
increasing or decreasing, emerged. Some reported drastic increase in sexual abuse cases while others stated 
that this is only due to improvement in reporting of cases. Overall, this indicated the sensitively involved in 
discussing sexual abuse.
• Mothers showed relatively better knowledge on sexual abuse as compared to children, but both showed need 
for improvement. 
• For child online sexual abuse and exploitation, low reporting was hindered by low knowledge of the mother. 
While other stakeholders (government officials and NGOs) acknowledge the issue of OCSEA. 
• Majority of the children had access to smart phones but less the half of them (46%) reported their parent 
supervising their activities. Lack of parent supervision was reported as one of the key factors leading to 
misuse of social media, pornography addiction, etc. Similarly, only 55% of mothers reported willingness to 
report a case of OCSEA. 
• Overall, the study captured prevalence of 5 key child protection issues and highlights the key indicators to be 
focused by future intervention. It also captures prevalence of associated themes like school enrolment, mental 
health of children, agency of children, economic vulnerabilities of families, parental support practices etc.
• The findings indicate need for a comprehensive and collaborative approach to child protection. Future 
intervention should actively engage individuals, communities, educational institutions, and policymakers 
for an effective and sustainable intervention. Furthermore, the findings call out for urgent need in shifting 
societal beliefs, norms, and practices to combat stigma, creating a protective environment for children.1

1.1 Background and Context of the KAWACH Program 
Child protection has emerged as a crucial priority across the world, especially in India. The rate of crimes against 
children in the country increased from 28.9 per lakh children in 2020 to 33.6 in 2021 (National Crime Records 
Bureau 2022)4. In consideration of the prevailing child protection issues in India, the British Asian Trust (BAT) 
and Children’s Investment Foundation Fund (CIFF) have commissioned the KAWACH program, to construct 
a comprehensive prevention model to establish a secure ecosystem, mitigate vulnerabilities, and bolster the 
prosecution of traffickers and exploiters.  
Of the many child protection issues that are prevalent in the country, the KAWACH program focuses on 5 major 
ones-
Child Marriage - It is one of the oldest and most pressing child protection issues. According to a report by UNICEF 
in 20235, India has the highest number of girls and women who were married during their childhood. Uttar 
Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh collectively account for more than half of these 
cases in the country. 
Child Labor –The prevalence of child labor persists due to factors like poverty, lack of access to education, and 
social norms. As per Census 20116, the number of working children in the age group of 5-14 years is 43.53 lakh. 
In our country, over half of the total child labour population works in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya 
Pradesh, and Maharashtra7. 
Child Trafficking – According to the ILO’s 2005 Global Report, Asia 8 has the highest number of child trafficking 
victims. In India, West Bengal, particularly along the borders of Bangladesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra 
witness significant cases of child labour. In addition to this. Jharkhand and Bihar, marked by poverty and limited 
educational opportunities, are source areas for child trafficking in the country.  
Child sexual abuse  - Child sexual abuse in India affects children across various age groups, socioeconomic 
backgrounds, and geographical locations9. The NCRB report highlights a 16.2% increase in crime against children 
in 2021 compared to the previous year. Cultural norms and limited access to education has led to massive 
underreporting of these cases.

Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation - The widespread availability of internet access and the increasing use 
of digital devices have created an environment where children are vulnerable to exploitation. As per a global 
survey10, 54 per cent of the young population reported having experienced online sexual harm before they were 
18 years old. Online child abuse cases started being reported in India in 2008 but have increased by significant 
numbers since the Covid-19 pandemic across the country.11

The Government of India has implemented various laws in the past which are aimed at safeguarding the welfare 
of children. Acts such as the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act (2015), the Protection of Children from 
Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (2006) have proven effective in reducing 
offenses against children. In addition to legal measures, the government has established the National Commission for 
Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) as a statutory body to oversee the enforcement of laws and ensure the protection 
of children’s rights. Complementing these efforts, various schemes such as Integrated Child Protection Scheme, Sarva 
Shiksha Abhiyan, National Child Labour Project Scheme and Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Abhiyan have been introduced 
to promote and uphold child rights. The efforts of both the National and State Government is reflected in their budget 
allocation for various child protection effort. In last decade, the union budget has seen significant reduction towardas 
funds allocated to children. In 2022-23 the budget for children stood at 2.35% of union budget which is significant 
drop from 4.76%.12 The tables below shows that allocation to children has consistently reduced each year, over the 
last decade.  The table below provides a snapshot budgetary allocation on various scheme in recent years. 
Despite the establishment of various laws and policies by the government to safeguard children, the successful 
implementation of these measures remains a challenge. Inadequate enforcement mechanisms result in 
protection loopholes, particularly in areas such as combating trafficking, enforcing child labour regulations, and 
rehabilitating rescued children. There is a pressing need for improvement in these aspects. Additionally, the lack 
of awareness among communities and parents regarding child rights and protective measures leads to children 
being more vulnerable to such incidents. The increased use of digital platforms poses an emerging threat, making 
it necessary to take measures to protect children from online exploitation and cyberbullying. It has become 
crucial to incorporate strategies for digital literacy and online safety into child protection initiatives. Effectively

addressing these issues demands a comprehensive, collaborative approach involving government agencies, non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), communities, and other stakeholders.
The British Asian Trust is introducing the KAWACH initiative to bridge the prevalent gaps in the existing solutions. 
Over the next decade, the program aspires to achieve a 30% reduction in child labour, child trafficking, child 
marriage, and commercial sexual exploitation of children, as well as a 50% reduction in online child sexual abuse 
and exploitation, specifically in the states where these crimes against children are most prevalent. 
The program mainly aims to achieve the following objectives: 
1. To execute a comprehensive prevention model and enhance prosecution to diminish the occurrences of 
Child Trafficking, Child Labour, Child Marriage, Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, and Online Child 
Sexual Abuse and Exploitation in India by the year 2031. 
2. To establish an ecosystem that encourages extensive collaboration, fosters data-driven methodologies, 
promotes innovation, and implements best practices.
3. To disseminate the integrated program model, ensuring its recognition and adoption in other states.
4. To ensure the availability of increased resources for the Child Protection sector in India
To obtain a systematic understanding of the current status of child protection issues in India, Athena Infonomics LLC 
(Athena) has been engaged to carry out a Baseline study of the KAWACH program. This baseline evaluation report serves 
as a compass, guiding stakeholders toward a more robust and effective child protection paradigm.
1.2 Scope and Objectives of the Baseline Evaluation
1.2.1 Evaluation Objectives
The baseline evaluation of the KAWACH program seeks to assess the current prevalence, knowledge, attitudes, 
and perceptions of child protection from various stakeholders across different levels. This evaluation focuses on 
5 key child protection issues persisting in India- child marriage, child labour, child trafficking, Child Sexual Abuse 
(CSA), and Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (OCSAE).
This study serves to comprehensively assess the prevailing situation, delving into the specific forms and root 
causes of child exploitation. BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 21

This section begins by briefly outlining the baseline methodology and then explains other details of the evaluation about 
sampling, sample size, data collection process, ethical considerations, and the challenges and limitations of the study.
 
2.1 Mixed-method approach 
The baseline evaluation used a mixed method approach which employs a comprehensive mix of quantitative and 
qualitative methodologies. 
The following methods were used to evaluate the baseline results-
• Network Scale-up Method for Prevalence estimation derived from the quantitative survey. 
• Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices/Perspectives of various stakeholders on different child protection issues 
through In-depth Interviews and Focused Group Discussions. 
2.1.1 Quantitative Survey
2.1.1.1 Prevalence Estimation
It is essential to understand that estimating the prevalence of sensitive child protection issues, especially among 
hidden populations like children who are victims of such crimes, is challenging. Therefore, in contrast to the 
conventional survey approaches, this study utilizes network scale-up methods (NSUM), tapping into respondents’ 
social networks to gather information about the hidden population.

The network scale-up method (NSUM)
• A prevalence estimation technique primarily used to measure the prevalence of hidden populations, such as 
the number of people trafficked in each region.15 
• Based on the logic of social network analysis- it assumes that individuals in each geographic area have variable 
knowledge of other individuals residing in the same geographic area, based on the strength and location of 
their network ties. 
• By utilizing NSUM, one can produce prevalence estimates by determining the proportion of people who have 
the characteristic of interest in the social network of respondents (e.g., the proportion of people that the 
respondent knows that have experienced trafficking) and then “scaling up” to the population level.16
The Knowledge Question and the know population subgroups
• The logic of NSUM is based on the proportion of known individuals by the respondent in the population of 
interest. Thus, the first task of a proper NSUM estimation should be to conceptualize what it means to know 
someone in the context of the data collection. 17 That is, one must inform the respondent what constitutes 
“knowing” an individual in the context of the data collection. 
• When considering known population questions, it is imperative that sufficient data sources are available  to 
inform the research about the actual prevalence of these known population questions. That is what makes 
these “known” population subgroups. To estimate networks, statistics about the known population must be 
available at the same geographical level (e.g., city, prefecture, region, or country) as the hidden population 
for which prevalence estimation is sought. (Please refer to Annexure 11, for an example outlining the detailed 
steps undertaken and the calculation done for calculation N-SUM prevalence.) 
Data Collection
• Collecting NSUM indicators ideally involves conducting household surveys clustered by each geographic 
region of interest. Household survey techniques rely on random sampling methods, which is imperative 
for generating a representative sample. By clustering random sampling by region, separate representative 
samples can be produced for each region of interest. If a proper random sample is not achieved, then NSUM 
estimates become biased as the networks of the respondents do not necessarily resemble the networks of 
the population. 
The next page outlines the steps undertaken in this study to undertake the data collection and analysis 
using the Network-Scale-Up method. For this study, the definition of someone in your network/knowing 
someone was defined as done in a study by UNAIDS on estimating the prevalence of HIV (UNAIDS) 18

The questions were 
chosen based on 
their relevance to 
the local context 
and the availability 
of secondary data 
for these subgroups 
within the entire 
population.

Mothers were 
selected as the 
respondent group 
for the study as they 
a re more involved 
in their children's 
lives and community 
affairs. This provides 
them with valuable 
insights into children's 
experiences, needs, 
and vulnerabilities. 
Additionally, they are 
more aware of the 
community affairs as 
well.
The personal network 
size (c) of mothers for 
a district is calculated 
using the number of

Limitations of NSUM
While NSUM has notable strengths over other prevalence methods, it also comes with its limitations. 
• NSUM does not directly interact with the hidden population in question, relying instead on network data from 
individuals who “know” members of the hidden population. Because of this, NSUM only produces aggregated 
estimates of the hidden population and does not reliably provide characteristic information on the hidden 
population beyond simple demographics. 
• NSUM also requires extensive existing data infrastructure, as census estimates of known sub-populations 
must be obtained in advance of data collection. 
• Finally, NSUM contains three major biases that must either be addressed or accounted for when calculating 
prevalence estimates. 
Table 2.1.1: Biases of N-SUM, and the mitigation techniques
Bias Definition Mitigation technique
1.  Transmission 
Bias
Transmission bias occurs when a respondent 
fails to recognize that they know something 
about their friends and acquaintances (Yang 
and Yang 2017)19. Not knowing facts about 
people in the network because those people do 
not communicate that  information or because 
the information is not readily observable is a 
transmission problem (Kadushin, Kilworth, 
Bernard, and Beveridge, 200620. 
•  Mothers are more involved in their children’s 
lives, which provides them with valuable 
insights into their children’s experiences, 
needs, and vulnerabilities.
•  Additionally, women tend to be more 
involved in community affairs, engage in 
social interactions, and have networks of 
relationships with neighbors and community 
members. 
2. Barrier Bias Barrier bias describes the various physical 
and social barriers that can prevent knowing 
people in various populations (Maltiel, Raftery, 
McCormick, and Baraff 2016)21. Barrier bias 
occurs from the non-random mixing of people 
in a society. In this way, knowing people is 
often influenced by a person’s context and 
characteristics.
•  Utilizing random sampling is a strategy to 
mitigate barrier bias. Hence, a systematic 
random sampling method was employed 
for the baseline survey to ensure a fair and 
unbiased selection process.
3. Recall Bias Recall bias occurs when the respondent does 
not accurately recall the number of people that 
they know in the subpopulations that we ask 
them about22 23.
•  It was clearly defined what it means to “know” 
someone in the context of the survey. 
•  Several known population questions were 
asked to exercise respondents’ memory before 
dwelling on questions on hidden population. 
•  Intensive training of field team

Table 2.1.2  : Sample Size of Quantitative Survey
2.1.1.2 Sampling for Quantitative Survey
To estimate the baseline vulnerabilities, a cluster random sampling technique was employed, with clusters formed 
at the village level. Sampling was done to ensure district-level representation. Systematic random sampling was 
used to select households from each village. The sample size (N) was calculated using the one-sample formula for 
cross-sectional studies, given by:
=
2
2  
Where: D is the design effect (set as 1.2) to account for clustering 
             P is the proportion of the outcome indicator (assumed as 0.5 or 50%) 
             Q is the complement of P (1 - P) 
              Z is the z-score corresponding to a 90% significance level (set as 1.64)
             E is the maximum allowable error (set as 5%)
Based on these values, the required sample size in each district came out to be 370 respondents. To accommodate 
non-responses, this size was increased by 10%. Hence, the desired sample size for each district, was set at 410 
participants. Furthermore, within each district, 10 Villages (clusters) were selected.

The following steps were followed in the baseline study of the KAWACH program to estimate N-SUM 
prevalence for each child protection issues 
Step 1: Selection of 
10 Villages
A list of all the villages was 
sourced from Census 2011 
data. 10 villages from each 
district were selected using 
Probability Proportion to size. 
The steps for the systematic sampling followed were: 
Step 2: Selection of 
Households 
In each village a total of 41 
households were selected 
using a systematic sampling 
method. T alked to AWW and 
found out the total number of 
households in the village. 
Estimated 
sampling interval 
by dividing the 
total number 
of households 
by the required 
sample. For 
example: if the 
total number of 
households was 
220 then the 
sampling interval 
was 4 (220/55). 
Found the 
centre location 
of the village. 
Rotated a 
pencil/pen and 
moved towards the 
direction pointed 
out by the pen.  
Selected the 
house no. as 
decided by 
sampling interval. 
Example: if the 
sampling interval 
is 4 then the 
4th house was 
selected.  
If a child aged 
13-18 was 
there then the 
survey tool was 
implemented 
with the child 
and mother, else 
the next 4th 
household was 
chosen. 
Followed this 
strategy till the 
required number 
of households 
was completed 
in the village. BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 29

Given the wide scope of the study covering 5 child protection issues, it was difficult to operationalize a detailed 
FGD covering all the themes in one 45–60-minute discussion. Therefore, in the interest of detailing each issue, 
the FGDs were conducted theme-wise, the details for which are enclosed below. Also, OCSEA was not covered 
with younger children (aged 11 to 15 years), as they would be less exposed to the internet and devices at a 
younger age.BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 31

2.3 Challenges and limitations of the study  
• In West Bengal and Bihar, the data 
collection coincided with the Durga 
Puja festivities and the government 
stakeholders were not available for 
surveys, leading to delays.
• In Rajasthan, due to the upcoming 
election announcements, section 144 
was imposed. This led to challenges in 
conducting FGDs in the state. 
• Non-response from primary and 
secondary list of stakeholders - As the 
study involved sensitive child protection 
issues, stakeholders were hesitant to be 
a part of the interview which led to non-
response. In some instances, government 
stakeholders demanded a letter of 
permission from authoritative sources.
• Multiple rescheduling of interviews was 
requested by government stakeholders 
such as the DLSAs and the DoW&CD, 
given their busy schedules. Due to this, 
the team had to spend longer time on 
the field than anticipated. 
• As the children were in schools during 
weekdays, it was challenging for the field 
team to find them in households during 
the daytime. This led to instances where 
the field team could not interview the 
mother and child in a household at a given 
time and had to revisit such households 
later in the evening/ time suggested 
by the mother to interview the child. 
This resulted in increased footwork for 
enumerators which affected the overall 
efficiency of the team and hence the 
data collection timelines. 
• There were additional challenges faced 
by the field team to complete the sample 
for male children. Field observations 
suggested that it was difficult to find male 
children of the age group 13-18 years in 
their homes, in the evening as well. They 
were either playing outside/ meeting 
friends or engaged in some chores. 
• Observations from the field pointed 
towards the underreporting of child 
protection issues by mothers. Few 
instances were observed by the 
enumerators where the child in the house 
was married or engaged in employment 
activity and the mother was not willing 
to report any child marriage or child 
labor instance during the survey.
• Despite enumerators clearly outlining 
the confidentiality and privacy aspect 
of the consent, they observed hesitancy 
from respondents during the survey. This 
was more prevalent during the Network 
Scale-Up section of the mother’s survey.

States where stakeholders reported less or rare incidents of child marriage mainly pointed out constant 
awareness campaigns run by government department and NGOs, active reporting by the villagers/ social 
workers/ community level workers; knowledge and capacity building of the entire child protection ecosystem, 
checks and balances applied by the laws and policies; active involvement of the NGOs in eradicating the 
child marriage. T alking about decline in cases, one of the stakeholders mentioned, “We are doing a lot of 
awareness programme involving different departments and NGOs. This has a great impact on decreasing child 
marriage. Secondly, spreading awareness among the people is another reason for the decline. Campaigns are being 
run intermittently. This is just to make people aware through NGOs through publicity in every village during the 
wedding season”.

These 903 mothers were spread across 91 villages. Out of the total 160 villages where the survey was conducted, 
69 villages had no reporting of any child marriage cases. (Refer to table A.3.15 in Annexure 3)
24.  Across all districts, there were number of mothers, who when asked “how many children did they know who got married before the age of 18” , reported “don’t know” or 
“refused to answer” , and refused to give us a number. In such cases, we this study has assumed that they must have seen at least one such case, given that initially they 
said “yes” when asked if they knew at least one child who got married before the age of 18. This assumption was made for other child protections issues as well.44 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM

On average, across all 16 sampled districts, a mother knew 1 case of a boy, who was married before the age of 18 
years, whereas they knew 2 cases of girls who got married before the age of 18 years in the last 1 year 25 (Refer 
to table 3.2.2). 
The maximum number of cases was reported from Durgapur village, located in the Katihar district of Bihar, where 
a mother reported 14 child marriage cases of boys. In Kapasdanga village in Murshidabad, the mother reported 
to know the highest number of child marriage cases of girls (17 cases). Chandauli district from Uttar Pradesh had 
only one mother who reported knowing 12 boys and 15 girls who got married before the age of 18 years. The 
mother belonged to Marui village in Chandauli.
The highest number of child marriage cases were estimated for the districts of West Bengal. However, the highest 
prevalence rate of child marriage was estimated in Bihar.
The highest number of child marriage cases were estimated in Darbhanga (Girls 3,10,964; Boys 2,71,826) and 
Murshidabad (Girls 2,54,753; Boys 1,05,081). Whereas the highest prevalence of child marriage was estimated 
from Darbhanga (Girls 35.6%; Boys 27 .9%), Katihar (Girls 26.6%; Boys 11%); and Gaya (Girls 24%; Boys 15.9%) 
(Refer to table 3.2.3). 
Data from the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5 26) indicates that the prevalence of child marriage in 
India is 27% (rural) for girls and 21.1% (rural) for boys. In Darbhanga (35.6%) and Katihar (26.6%), the prevalence 
rate of child marriage among girls was estimated to be close to the national average. 
The diversity of perspectives within the same state on the prevalence of child marriage underscores the complex 
and varied nature of the issue, influenced by regional factors, cultural practices, and levels of awareness and 
education.
Interviews with NGOs workers and other stakeholders present mixed opinions regarding the prevalence of 
child marriage in the states. While respondents in UP and Bihar reported decreasing trends in the prevalence of 
child marriage on account of increased awareness regarding the consequence of child marriage, respondents 
in West Bengal reported that there has been an increase in child marriage in the states. 
We observed an intra-state variation in the perspectives of respondents concerning the prevalence of child 
marriage. For instance, stakeholders in Bamer expressed concerns about child marriage being a significant issue, 
attributing it to prevalent cultural practices. In contrast, stakeholders in Jaipur believed that child marriage was 
on the decline due to increased urbanization, heightened awareness, and a higher level of education.
Similarly, in Uttar Pradesh (UP), there were conflicting reports among stakeholders. Some indicated a 
decline in child marriage cases, while others highlighted its persistence in specific locations such as Harraiya, 
Satdharwa, Tulsipur, Ghaisdi, Pachpedwa, and the Tharu belt.

The overall average child marriage prevalence using N-SUM is estimated to be 19.4% for girls, and 9.38% for 
boys, which is lower than the last national average (measured in year 2019). However, it’s important to note the 
methodological difference between how the prevalence rates are calculated in this report, and in NFHS. 
Limitation in NSUM estimate for lower response rates-  N-SUM, methodologically, calculates the prevalence 
estimates using the census population of the subgroup in question (children aged 18 years and below, in the case 
of this study) While doing so, it does not account for the low response rate
“
The situation of child marriage in **** district is very bad, most of the cases are of child marriage which we are not 
able to stop. The child marriage is highest among Jat and Vishnoi castes. Recently there was report of 50 child 
marriages have taken place in a single pandal. The existing practice of marrying children during any gathering such 
as funeral service in a family in the village as that reduces the cost of marriage has led to increased prevalence on 
child marriage. – Government Stakeholder, West Bengal

3.2.2 Knowledge related to child marriage among mothers and children 
A very small proportion of respondents reported the legal age to be less than 18 years (0.5% mothers; 1.3% 
children) and 21 years (7% mothers; 10.3% children) for girls and boys respectively.
Almost all the mothers (98.4%; refer to table 3.2.4) reported the legal age of marriage to be 18 years or above 
across all 16 sampled districts. 67 .4% reported the correct response of 18 years as the legal age of marriage for 
girls. Districts of Rajasthan had highest percentage of mothers giving the correct response- Bharatpur (93%), 
followed by Bamer (88%) and Jaipur (82%). In contrast, the lowest prevalence of correct response was reported 
from Bihar and UP- Sitamarhi (Bihar) (45%), followed by Balrampur (UP) (48%) and Bareilly (UP) (50%). An 
extremely small proportion of 0.5% mothers reported less than 18 years as the legal age of marriage for girls. 
The lowest reported age was 10 years by a mother in Dungarpur district of Rajasthan. (Refer to table A.3.1 in 
Annexure 3)
More than 50% of the mothers across all the districts reported 21 years to be the legal age of marriage (Refer 
to table 3.2.4). The districts with the highest percentage of mothers giving the correct response were from 
Rajasthan- Bamer (90%), followed by Bharatpur (86%) and Jaipur (73%). In contrast, the lowest prevalence of 
correct response was reported from UP- Balrampur (26%) and Bareilly (50%). The incorrect legal age of marriage 
(less than or more than 21 years) was reported by a lower proportion of mothers across all districts. The lowest 
reported age of marriage for boys was 17 years by a mother in Dungarpur district. (Refer to table A.3.1 in 
Annexure 3)

Using photovoice technique, children across four states and 16 districts were shown pictures about child 
marriage to find out if they could identify child marriage and if they knew about legal age of child marriage. 
The children were shown multiple pictures of child marriage, where all brides were children of different 
ages and grooms in each picture were of different age groups, starting from children to young and aged 
adults. Across the four states, children were able to accurately identify the issue as child marriage. They also 
displayed correct knowledge about the correct legal age of marriage. Children were aware that 18 is the legal 
minimum age for marriage for girls in India and 21 for boys.BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 47

Similar to mothers, more than 60% of the children across all the districts rightly reported the legal age of marriage 
for girls to be 18 years (Refer to table 3.2.5). Bharatpur (90.5%), and Barmer (82.2%) remained to be districts 
with higher reported knowledge on the legal age of marriage for girls. In contrast, the lowest knowledge among 
children related to the legal age of marriage of girls was reported in Darjeeling and Sitamarhi. (Refer to Table A.3.2 
in Annexure 3). 
While the majority of responses from each district indicated that the legal age of marriage for girls was 18 years 
and boys was 21 years, a slightly higher proportion of children as compared to mothers, reported the legal age 
to be lesser than the correct response. The findings also highlight the necessity of enhancing knowledge and 
awareness of the same among mothers and children, particularly in districts with a lower prevalence of correct 
responses. 
Across all 16 districts, the most common reason reported by mothers for marrying girls and boys before the legal 
age of marriage (18 for girls and 21 for boys) was the fear of them eloping or having an affair (72% for girls; 64% 
for boys).
It can be observed that a slightly higher proportion of mothers cited reasons such as the fear of elopement and 
pressure from relatives as factors contributing to early marriage of girls. However, when it comes to boys, there 
persists a prevailing notion that early marriage fosters responsibility in them (Refer to table A.3.16 in Annexue 3).

Reasons for early marriage
A vast majority of the children also expressed strong negative reactions against early marriage. They 
expressed their feelings and understanding through words such as ‘bad’, ‘sad to see’, pointed out as ‘everything 
is wrong’ and ‘ nothing to feel good about these pictures as they are getting married at a very young age’ . “This is 
a picture of the marriage ceremony. I don’t feel good because a child is getting married with an old man.” –

Across all sampled districts barring Dungarpur and Jaipur districts of Rajasthan, 85%-95% mothers reported 
early pregnancy and the associated risk for child and mother as a negative consequence of child marriage. Some 
of the other negative consequences which were reported include increased risk of domestic violence (54%) and 
risk on mental health (37%) (Refer to figure 3.2.2).
While the mothers are aware of the consequences which have a bearing on their health, it is crucial to note that, a 
relatively lesser proportion of mothers across all districts reported important negative consequences of marrying 
at a younger age associated with education and financial responsibilities. Some of these include children dropping 
out of schools/colleges, children forced to start working at an early age, and increased financial responsibilities.

Child marriage is not acceptable under any circumstances. If they get married, they have to face physical and 
mental problems. She is forced to do household work which is difficult for her. Marrying at early age weakens the 
body and leads to diseases. – Children FGD
It is unacceptable because it violates children’s rights, robbing them of their childhood, education, and health. 
Young brides often face physical and emotional harm. – Children FGD
3.2.3 Attitudes related to child marriage among mothers and children
The mothers in Balrampur and Katihar showcase a greater need for a shift in attitudes and beliefs related to early 
marriage, this was also observed for children in Barmer and Dungarpur.
Out of the 16 sampled districts, the composite score of mothers for attitudes related to early marriage was lowest 
for districts Balrampur and Katihar (0.6). Although a high proportion of mothers in Balrampur agreed with the 
notion that education protects girls (98.5%), a very small percentage of mothers (3.2%), disagreed with the belief 
that marriage offers protection to girls (Refer to table 3.2.6).  
Following Balrampur, the composite scores for Bareilly, Chandauli, Dungarpur, and Barmer districts were also 
relatively lower (0.7) than other sampled districts. It is interesting to note that in these districts as well, a high 
proportion of mothers associate early marriage with the protection of girls. All 4 sampled districts of West Bengal 
have a composite score of 0.9, showcasing the better beliefs and attitudes of mothers related to early marriage in 
this state, as compared to the other three. 50 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM

The children from West Bengal showcase better attitudes and beliefs related to early marriage.
It is observed in table 3.2.7 , that the composite score of children for attitudes related to early marriage was lowest 
for Barmer  (Rajasthan) (0.5). A small percentage of mothers (27 .1%) disagreed with the belief that marriage 
offers physical and financial protection to girls. Only 36%-47% of children from Barmer disagreed with other 
conservative beliefs associated with marriage, such as- physical change in a girl’s body is a sign that she is ready for 
marriage (36.3%); seizing a good opportunity of marriage is more important than continuing education (47 .8%); 
and marriage is an opportunity for repaying debts (41.2%). 
Similar to mothers, a low proportion of children across all 16 sampled districts disagreed with the notion of 
associating early marriage of girls with protection (37 .2%), with the lowest percentage observed in Dungarpur 
(14.6%)
As compared to the mothers, the composite scores for attitudes and beliefs for children witnessed a decline in 
some districts (such as Murshidabad, Jalpaiguri- mothers 0.9; children 0.8). 
The trends in table 3.2.6 and table 3.2.7 showcase a need for a shift in the overall prevailing attitudes towards 
early marriage.
In interviews and focus group discussion stakeholders expressed their negative attitude towards this practise. 
All of them felt it was unacceptable to practise child marriage. They used words like ‘ dated’, ‘backward’ 
‘atrocity’, ‘crime’, ‘evil’ and ‘injustice’ to express their sentiments on the topic.Royal Blue Golden Yellow

In comparison with mothers, children are more likely to report a case or seek help from an authority Mothers 
and children from Bharatpur and Dungarpur districts of Rajasthan had the lowest proportions of responses for 
reporting of cases or seeking help in case of witnessing/knowing of a child marriage case in the community.
More than 50% of the mothers reported that they would either try to counsel the parents who are getting 
the child married (43%) or report to the concerned authorities (13%). The highest proportion of mothers who 
reported counseling other parents were from Jaipur (Rajasthan) (70%) and report to concerned authorities were 
from Jalpaiguri (West Bengal)  (37 .5%).
It is also observed that about 1/3rd of the mothers reported that they will not do anything, in case they witness 
a case of child marriage in the community (29.3%) or will support it (4.5%). (Refer to table  A.3.4 in Annexure 3)
It was observed that a rather higher proportion (72.9%) of children reported that they would seek support 
or report the case to an authority if they found any friend or relative getting married before the legal age of 
marriage. The highest proportions were reported from all 4 districts of West Bengal (97%-99%). The proportion 
of responses of children regarding seeking help or reporting child marriage remained low for Chandauli (UP) 
(43.9%), Bharatpur (Rajasthan) (42.9%), and Dungarpur (Rajasthan) (42.4%). (Refer to table A.3.7 in Annexure 3).
For both mothers and children, the most common sources for reporting a case of child marriage in the community 
were reported to be police.
95% of the mothers reported that they would seek help or report to the police in case they came across a case 
of child marriage in the community.  While all the mothers (100%) from Uttar Pradesh said they would report 
to police, only 33.3% of mothers from Jaipur district in Rajasthan reported this. Interestingly, only in Jaipur, the 
common choice for mothers to seek any help around this issue, was observed to be the village child protection 
committee (66.7% of mothers in Jaipur). (Refer to table A.3.6 in Annexure 3).

Focus group discussions with children reveal that that children emphasize a collaborative approach involving 
parents, teachers, police, NGOs, and helplines to prevent child marriages and protect kids. 
If children come across a child marriage, they have clear ideas on what to do. They stress the importance of 
talking to the family first as one child says, “I will ask him to study and try to convince someone from his family. I 
will ask the schoolteachers to contact.” Another suggests talking to parents directly, saying, “If something like 
this happens in our village, then we should first talk to their parents and make them understand that child 
marriage should not be done; it is wrong.” The general consensus is that if parents don’t agree, it’s crucial to 
involve other adults. Additionally, helplines are suggested, with one child saying, “If we find such children, you 
will call the police, inform 112, inform the women’s helpline.”
95% of the mothers reported that they would seek help or report to the police in case they came across a case 
of child marriage in the community.  While all the mothers (100%) from Uttar Pradesh said they would report 
to police, only 33.3% of mothers from Jaipur district in Rajasthan reported this. Interestingly, only in Jaipur, the 
common choice for mothers to seek any help around this issue, was observed to be the village child protection 
committee (66.7% of mothers in Jaipur). (Refer to table A.3.6 in Annexure 3).
Police were also the most reported choice for children (77 .8%) (Refer totable A.3.8 in Annexure 3). Some of the lesser 
reported sources for mothers were AWWs/ASHA workers (10%); the village child protection committee (10.7%) and 
the local child marriage probation officer (5.6%). Teachers were reported by a small proportion of children (26.8%). 
3.2.4 Practices related to child marriage
The data from both mothers and children indicates a high practice of child marriage in Murshidabad district of 
West Bengal.
Approximately 1/4th of the mothers (23.2%) who were interviewed for the baseline survey across all districts 
reported that they have heard or witnessed a case of child marriage in their neighbor or community. The highest 
proportion of mothers from Murshidabad (West Bengal) (78.5%) reported incidence of child marriage. This was 
followed by Katihar (Bihar) (39.8%) and North Parganas (West Bengal) (37 .1%). (Refer to table A.3.9 in Annexure 3). 
The lowest proportions of incidence of child marriage were reported in UP- Bharatpur (2.9%) and Chandauli (3.7%). 
Murshidabad district in West Bengal had the highest proportion of children who married at a young age - self-
reported child marriage (4.4%) and early marriage among friends and relatives (28.8%).
Of all the children surveyed (N=6560) across 16 districts, only 0.4% were reported to be currently married. It can 
also be observed that the self-reported cases of early marriage were from the following 6 districts – Balrampur 
(0.7%); Dungarpur (0.2%); Bramer (0.2%); North Parganas (0.2%); Murshidabad (4.4%); Katihar (0.7%) (Refer to 
table A.3.10 in annexure 3).
However, a higher proportion of children (6.5%), reported knowing a friend or relative who got married before 
the age of 18 years. Murshidabad and Katihar had the highest prevalence- 28.8% and 13.8% respectively. (Refer 
to table A.3.11 in Annexure 3)BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 55

2.6% (167) mothers reported that they know at least 1 or more children who were victims of child labor. The 
highest proportion of mothers reporting a child labor incidence was observed from West Bengal- Murshidabad 
(20.2%), followed by North Parganas (5.8%) (Refer to table 3.3.1).
Mothers from various districts reported no cases of child labor- Bareilly, Prayagraj, Chandauli, Bharatpur, Barmer, 
Jaipur, Darjeeling, and Sitamarhi.
The 167 mothers (2.6%) who reported that they knew at least one case of child labor, were spread across only 
38 villages (Refer to table A.24 in Annexure 4). Therefore, out of the total 160 villages where the survey was 
conducted, 122 villages had no reporting of any child labor case.
On average a mother reported knowing more than 2 boys who were victims of child labor. 
On average, a mother knew 2.5 cases of boys who were victims of child labor. Mothers from Murshidabad reported 
the highest average cases of boys who they knew were victims of child labor (3 cases) (Refer to table 3.3.2).
The maximum number of child labor cases amongst boys was reported from Khandail village in Gaya, Bihar- a 
mother reported to know 10 boys who were victims of child labor. While the cases of child labor among girls were 
considerably lower as opposed to boys, a mother from Palmathu Gamra from Dungarpur, Rajasthan reported to 
know 5 cases of girls who were victim of child labor. (Refer to Annexure 4 for the list of villages)
Qualitative findings suggest a significant level of underreporting of child labor cases in the community. One of 
the reasons highlighted during the qualitative interactions was how child labor cases are generally concealed 
within family assistance roles. “Child labor is on the rise, often concealed within family assistance roles, making it 
challenging to address effectively.” – Government Stakeholder, Bihar.

The qualitative findings capture mixed response on the prevalence of child labor. Stakeholders in West Bengal and 
Bihar acknowledges it as a prevalent issue reporting an increase, particularly in concealed family roles.  In contrast, 
stakeholders in Rajasthan suggests a decrease due to stringent state measures against child labor. According to NGO 
personnel, “Rajasthan is the first state in India in which life imprisonment has been imposed in cases of child labor 
and trafficking.”
In Uttar Pradesh, conflicting reports on numbers exist, with concerns about unreported cases. A CWC official 
cited underreporting due to a lack of shelter facilities, while another stated stable numbers. Yet, one highlighted a 
decrease attributed to heightened awareness. DCPU authorities reported similar issues. DCPU authorities 
echoed similar concerns, and NGO personnel emphasized the challenge of obtaining authentic data on child 
labor. Despite uncertainties about trends, some NGO personnel described the situation as dire, citing recent 
rescues in hotels and dhabas.
Both girls and boys in the state conveyed the persistence of the problem, noting instances of child labor in 
fields and brick kilns. Some members of CPC in the state also perceived an increase. However, in contrast, 
some SMC members felt the issue is decreasing due to their active involvement. Some GP members also 
believed the problem is not prevalent. One GP member emphasized, “ In our panchayat, only adults go out for 
work. Children do not go to work. Only persons from 18 years and above go to work with the consent of their family.” 
SJPU members shared the sentiment, stating, “Due to increased awareness among citizens, the number of child 
marriages has decreased drastically.”
The prevalence rate of boys who faced child labor was 18% whereas for girls it was 0.9%.
The highest number of child labor cases were estimated from the districts of West Bengal and Bihar- Gaya (boys 
30,305,9; girls 27 ,942); Murshidabad (boys 23,501,9; girls 983). These districts also had the highest prevalence 
rates (Gaya- boys 30.2%; girls 3%); (Murshidabad- boys 18.2%; girls 0.5%).
“
Child labor persists, especially in brick kilns, factories, and sewing machines.

3.3.2 Knowledge and Awareness of child labor
A high proportion of mothers and children in West Bengal had received information on child labor. 
42.4% of mothers and 40.5% of children reported receiving information on child labor. The highest proportions of mothers 
to receive any information on this aspect were from the districts of West Bengal (Murshidabad 86.6%; North Parganas 
85.1%; Darjeeling 80.7%; Jalpaiguri 70.7%). Chandauli district (7 .8%) from UP and Barmer district (15.1%) from Rajasthan 
had the lowest proportion of mothers who received information on child labor.  (Refer to T able A.4.1 in Annexure 4).
The qualitative findings from the focus group discussions reveal that children have a comprehensive understanding of 
the detrimental effects of child labor. Their voices express a shared disapproval of this practice.
Our field team used photo prompts depicting children engaged in work to children across states and found 
that they were able to articulate that these children were being employed. In West Bengal (WB), one child 
straightforwardly stated, “Children are made to work for money.”  In Bihar, diverse perspectives emerged, 
with some children suggesting that these children worked under compulsion, while others asserted that 
the children did not wish to work but were forced to do so. The children’s reactions varied, encompassing 
sentiments such as the desire to play, attend school, or support their families after school hours. Some Bihar 
respondents highlighted that certain children spend their entire day in school and, after school, engage in 
work to contribute to their family’s well-being. One child from Bihar specifically mentioned that, as per their 
book, a child below 18 years should not be engaged in work for monetary gain, categorizing such situations 
as child labor. Another poignant observation from Bihar highlighted a stark dichotomy: “One side is school 
and another side is Bricklin. We think the child is going to work in Bricklin instead of school. I feel bad for them 
because child labour is not good.”  This sentiment reveals the child’s strong awareness of the issue. In Uttar 
Pradesh (UP), boys expressed a thorough understanding of the issue, emphasizing the importance of children 
attending school and studying instead of engaging in labor. One child advocated for education over child 
labor. “Children should study instead of this. If they read, they will get a job somewhere and they can get better 
remuneration. “Another child remarked, ‘’ It is a crime. At this age he needs education and studies.’’BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 59

Similar to mothers, the proportion of children who received information on child labor was highest in the districts of 
West Bengal, with the highest reported in Murshidabad (84.9%). While the lowest proportion of children who reported 
receiving any information on child labor was from Sitamarhi (13.2%) from Bihar (Refer to T able A.4.2 in Annexure 4)
Friends/acquaintances (61.3%), Radio/Television (57 .5%), and Community/group discussion were the top three 
sources of information on child labor for mothers (Refer to figure 3.3.1). Only 2% of mothers reported receiving 
information on NGO sensitization programs. (Refer to T able A.4.3 in Annexure 4). The most common source of 
information on child labor for children was reported to be teachers (54.3%), followed by peers/friends (49.6%), 
and Television (49.1%). More than 80% of children from the districts of Rajasthan reported teachers as the source 
of information for child labor (Bharatpur 89.3%; Barmer 89.1%; Dungarpur 88.1%; Jaipur 82.4%). 
Focus Group discussions and interviews with adult stakeholders unveiled comprehensive knowledge of child 
labor among different stakeholders.

Focus Group discussions and interviews with adult stakeholders unveiled comprehensive knowledge of child labor 
among different stakeholders. 
The NGO staff in West Bengal were aware that the situation was “deplorable,” with children involved 
in labor-intensive activities such as dyeing, printing, washing clothes, working in an oil refinery plant, and 
the hotel business. A government official from the state explained its occurrence in garages, dhabas, and 
hotels. Similarly, a government official in Rajasthan shed light on the migration of children of working age 
to Ahmedabad and Gujarat during study breaks in pursuit of employment opportunities. An Anganwadi 
representative in Rajasthan demonstrated awareness that children were compelled to work in shops, hotels, 
or as laborers, often facing exploitation with meager pay and long working hours. In Uttar Pradesh (UP), 
government officials acknowledged the issue of child labor, defining it as the forceful engagement of children 
below 18 years in work. A Gram Panchayat representative from UP recognized the widespread nature of 
child labor, citing its presence in industries such as “Bricklin, Dhaba, and hotels.60 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM

Mothers surveyed from West Bengal had greater awareness of laws related to protecting children from hazardous 
work, as opposed to mothers from Rajasthan.
Nearly 30% of the mothers reported being aware of a law or regulation that protects children from working on 
hazardous work. Mothers surveyed from districts of West Bengal had the highest awareness on this aspect. 50-
55% of mothers across all 4 districts of West Bengal were aware of a law or regulation that protects children from 
any work that is hazardous in nature (Jalpaiguri 55.6%; North Parganas 55.1%; Darjeeling 52%; Murshidabad 
51.2%). (Refer to T able A.4.5 in Annexure 4). The lowest awareness on this aspect was observed in Rajasthan. 
Only 7-10% of the mothers reported knowing any law or regulation that protects children from hazardous work 
(Bharatpur 7 .1%; Dungarpur 8.8%; Barmer 5.4%; Jaipur 10.5%).
Poverty was reported as the most prevalent reason for child labor by the majority of mothers across all 16 districts. 
Under the baseline survey, more than 2/3rd of the surveyed mothers (76.3%) reported that poverty was one of 
the many reasons why child labor prevails in the community. This was followed by other reasons such as death of 
parents (56.6%) and sickness of parents (41.6%). (Refer to T able A.4.6 in Annexure 4). 
It is important to note that only 25% of the mothers reported that child labor exists because children drop out of 
school. The lowest proportions of mothers from Chandauli (2.9%) and Prayagraj (4.1%) districts of UP reported 
this reason. This low prevalence shows a lack of knowledge among mothers of the importance of education in 
combating issues such as child labor in the community. (Refer to T able A.4.6 in Annexure 4).
Qualitative discussions with children, community and district level stakeholders also reveal poverty and economic struggles 
as causes for child labor. There are distinct yet interconnected narratives of the causes of child labor across states. 
In West Bengal, the closure of tea gardens in Darjeeling led to economic struggles, making children vulnerable 
to labor. Insights from a NGO personnel highlight the impact, “Out of 87 tea gardens in Darjeeling, 30 are closed, 
creating poverty among the population, compelling children to enter the labor force.”
Similarly, Bihar echoes a narrative of poverty-induced child labor, heightened by the economic repercussions 
of the pandemic. An NGO personnel in Bihar emphasizes, “Due to Covid, many factories have been closed, 
many people have lost their jobs, and most have become unemployed. Poverty is also a significant factor in 
this area.” Families, grappling with financial instability, are coerced into sending their children to work for 
survival. Another NGO personnel from Bihar reveals a stark reality, “Daily wage laborers don’t get much work 
during flood time. MNREGA also doesn’t give payment on time. So people don’t trust MNREGA. And the mentality of 
laborers is that they work for 10 days and rest for 4 days. In MNREGA, they don’t get work. Poverty and ignorance 
are the main causes of child labor.”
In Rajasthan, the surge in child labor is attributed to a lack of education and economic fragility. A government 
official in Rajasthan points out, “It is increasing due to a lack of education and economic weakness.” Similarly, in Uttar 
Pradesh, the allure of money forces poor parents to send their children as bonded labor. A NGO personnel in Uttar 
Pradesh said “Parents are responsible for this. Due to poverty, they had to allow children to work as child labor.”BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 61

The children’s voices emphasize the interconnected challenges of poverty and the pressing need for education. Children 
also expressed their views on the close connection between child labor, poverty, and family circumstances. 
One child in Uttar Pradesh said, “Child labor, poverty, not being able to go to school—these are all connected. We 
want to study and play, not work.” A child from West Bengal echoed similar sentiments, “No, what is seen is that 
in most cases the family is a little poorer, and it is more common among children who do not go to school.”
In the narratives that unfolded during the FGDs with children, a compelling and consistent theme emerged: a 
resolute and unanimous disapproval of child labor. Children from different states unanimously reject child 
labor, emphasizing the importance of studying and acquiring education for a better future. In West Bengal, 
children express strong disapproval of child labor, emphasizing the need to focus on studies. A child from 
West Bengal asserts, “This is not acceptable under any circumstances because at this age one should study.” A child 
from Uttar Pradesh said, “By reporting, we can save their life, and they will again go to school for study.” Children 
also prioritize education over economic work, highlighting that children should study first before considering 
any work opportunities. However, in one exception case, some boys from Bihar believed that engaging in 
labor allows children to meet their needs and acquire mobile phones.
3.3.3 Attitudes and Beliefs on Child Labor
For both children and mothers, there is a scope to enhance awareness, attitudes and beliefs related to child labor 
associated with children working in family settings.
The composite score for attitudes and beliefs of mothers related to child labor is the lowest in UP- Bareilly district 
(0.61), followed by Prayagraj (0.63). (Refer to table 3.3.4). 
Less than 50% of the mothers disagreed with the statement that children should work for their parents or relatives for free. 
67 .4% of the mothers agreed with the notion that there should be laws that punish individuals employing children in 
work that is inappropriate for their age. T able 3.3.4 shows that, less than 50% of the mothers from Balrampur, Sitamarhi, 
and, Barmer agreed with the statement, showcasing a scope for improvement of beliefs in this aspect in these districts.
The composite score for attitudes and beliefs of children related to child labor is lowest in Barmer (Rajasthan) (0.55), this 
was followed by Prayagraj (UP) (0.59) and Balrampur (UP) (0.62). Less than 50% of the children in Barmer disagreed 
with the statement ‘as long as it benefits the family, children should be allowed to do any kind of work’. In Prayagraj, only 
33.4% of children disagreed with the statement ‘If parents have no money, children should have to work anywhere’  
(Refer to table 3.3.5).62 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM

Only a small proportion (40.7%) of children across all 16 sampled districts disagreed with the idea that children 
should work for free for their parents and relatives. As shown in T able 3.3, districts of UP and Rajasthan had low 
percentages of children who disagreed with the notion of children working for free for family and relatives, with 
the lowest proportions in Prayagraj (9%) and Chandauli (5.4%).
It is important to note that there is a need and scope for enhancing the knowledge and awareness of mothers and 
children regarding the existence of child labor in family settings or disguised settings. 
A government official from West Bengal discussed presence of child labor in a disguised manner. The official 
noted that there have been cases related to child labor that, upon closer examination, were identified and 
subsequently addressed.
The perspectives of stakeholders, which included NGO personnel and the judiciary, portray a collective stance united 
against child labor. The NGOs emphasize the detrimental effects of child labor on human rights and education. Judicial 
representatives recognize challenges in implementation and advocate for comprehensive plans to address vulnerable 
families. NGO personnel believe in the critical role of financial harmony in successfully implementing child 
labor laws. They also stress the importance of effective collaboration among police, inter-departmental 
coordination, NGOs, and families to bring child labourers back on the right track. According to an NGO 
representative in West Bengal, “Laws can be successfully implemented only when there is financial harmony 
among all in society.” NGO staff firmly believe in the negative impact of child labor on human rights, education, 
and the overall well-being of children. A NGO representative in Bihar stated, “No child labor is acceptable, and 
there are several compelling reasons such as violation of human rights, impact on the education of children, physical 
health risk of the child, exploitation of children, impact on society, etc.” NGO staff also strongly feel the need for 
children to study and play in a nurturing environment.Royal Blue Golden Yellow

The lowest proportions of mothers and children from districts of Rajasthan reported seeking help or reporting a case of 
children working forcefully for someone. 
70.9% of the mothers would report an incident where the child is forced to work for someone against his/her will. 
The highest proportions of mothers reporting this were from Bareilly (UP) (93.2%), followed by Murshidabad 
(92.7%) and Darjeeling (90.5%) (West Bengal). The lowest proportion of mothers from Dungarpur (43.2%) and 
Barmer (47 .1%) districts of Rajasthan would report the case of a child working forcefully. (Refer to T able A.4.8 in 
Annexure 4).
 In comparison to mothers, a slightly higher proportion of children reported seeking support or reporting a 
case of child labor (78.2%). The highest proportion of children from the districts of West Bengal would report a 
case or seek support in case they or any of their friends get engaged in some work that they aren’t willing to do 
(Jalpaiguri 96.1%; Murshidabad 92.4%; North Parganas 91.2%; Darjeeling 84.6%). Similar to mothers, the lowest 
proportions of children from districts of Rajasthan- Dungarpur (57 .6%) and Bharatpur (53.4%) mentioned that 
they would report or seek help from someone. (Refer to T able A.4.9 in Annexure 4).

willingness to report or seek support if a child is enagged in child labor
The insights gathered from focus group discussions with children across different West Bengal, Bihar, Rajasthan, 
and Uttar Pradesh, underscore a thorough understanding on the significance of reporting child labor. Participants 
consistently highlighted the gravity of the issue, portraying it as a criminal act that deprives children of their right 
to education and a promising future. In West Bengal, children stated that reporting child labor is imperative 
because, at this tender age, children should be immersed in studies rather than economic activities. One 
participant expressed in the FGD, “Because it is a crime. At this age, he needs education and studies.” 66 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM

Police were reported as the most common choice for both mothers and children to report or seek help from in case 
they witness a case of child labor.
89.3% of mothers (Refer to T able A.4.11 in Annexure 4) and 67 .5% of the children (Refer to T able A.4.10 in 
Annexure 4) reported seeking support from the police in case they witness or know of a child who works for 
someone unwillingly.  A high proportion of children also reported seeking support from parents (60.1%).  (Refer 
to figure 3.3.3)
The findings suggest that a small proportion of respondents (children and mothers) would seek support from 
child protection committee members (mothers 4.5%; children 3.3%), NGO cells (mothers 0.9%; children 1.6%), or 
Juvenile police units (mothers 1.6%; children 4.7%).

Across states, common entities were identifying as potential avenues for assistance. Children recognized the 
pivotal roles of the police, teachers, and NGOs. One child said, “The police, teachers, or any NGO or Childline can 
help in this regard.” The hesitation of children to seek help was also acknowledged by some. They attributed it 
to factors like fear, shame, or parental pressure. In Bihar, one of the participants said, “Yes, a child in a situation 
of exploitation, such as child labor, may hesitate to seek help due to fear of whether they will help or not.”
Preventive measures involving schools, police administration, and societal figures were recommended. The 
need to create a supportive environment where children feel comfortable seeking help was a recurring 
theme. Participants stressed the importance of collaborative efforts, involving schools, police administration, 
influential community members, and organizations dedicated to children’s welfare. A participant from 
Rajasthan said, “According to me, all these organizations and individuals have almost equal involvement in stopping 
child labor because all are connected to each other.”BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 67

3.3.4 Practices related to child labor.
This section outlines the practices related to children in the age group of 13 to 18 years who are currently working 
including their employment status, working conditions, treatment in workplace, and interference of work with 
other activities. 
3.3.4.1 Employment Status
18.8 % of the children self-reported their involvement in employment activity, while only 8% of mothers confirmed 
their children’s work status.
Of the children surveyed across 16 districts, 18.8% (N= 1239) reported that they were currently working. The 
highest proportion of children who reported to be working belonged from Bareilly (UP) (18.24%), followed by 
districts of Rajasthan- Dungarpur (13.24%) and Barmer (10.98%). There were not many variations across the 
gender and age of these children. 
4.4% (N= 291) reported that their friends were involved in some kind of work. 
Around 18% of children stated they were working, but only 8% of mothers acknowledged that their children 
were currently employed. Field observations indicate that mothers might be hesitant to report their children’s 
involvement in work, possibly contributing to this observed difference.  (Refer to T able A.4.12 in Annexure 4)
Of all the children who reported to be currently working, and reported their friends to be working, the majority of 
them started working when they were 14 years of age or below. 
69% of children who self-reported that they were working somewhere, started working when they were 14 or 
below (Refer to T able A.4.14 in Annexure 4), 65.5% of children whose friends were working also reported that 
their friends started working at 14 years or below. (Refer to table A.4.22 in Annexure 4)
3.3.4.2 Source of introduction to work
More than 1/3rd of the children (77 .6%) who were working or whose friends were working, reported getting the 
current engagement with the help of a family member. 21.6% also reported getting the work through a friend, 
followed by online ads (4.1%), and through social media (2.3%). Unlike any other district, more than 50% of the 
working children in Katihar reported to get their job through online ads (28.5%) and social media (20%).  (Refer to 
T able A.4.15 in Annexure 4)
3.3.4.3 Working conditions of Children and their friends.
The majority of the children were working or helping in a household farm/plot (15.9%) or in a family business (6.8%).68 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM

Children from districts of West Bengal reported working for longer hours in a day as compared to other states. 
Of the children who reported that they are working, or their friend are working (N= 1363 of 6560), worked for an 
average of 3.6 hours per day. Children from Gaya in Bihar and Darjeeling in West Bengal reported to work for an 
average of 6.6 and 6.7 hours per day respectively, which was the highest amongst all districts. This was followed 
by North Parganas in West bengal, with an average of 5 hours per day.  (Refer to T able A.4.16 in Annexure 4)
3.3.4.3 Treatment in the workplace
A very small proportion of children reported that they were unable to leave the workplace where they were 
employed (3.9%). This was reported in 6 out of 16 sampled districts, namely- Gaya (40%), Barmer (17.1%), Prayagraj 
(11.1%), Murshidabad (4.8%), Katihar (4.6%), and Dungarpur (0.6%). (Refer to T able A.4.17 in Annexure 4)

Figure 3.3.5: Mother’s response on child’s usage of their own earned income (%) (N=513)
T able 3.3.6 shows how were the children treated in the place of work. Less than 10% of the children reported that 
they were either scolded (7 .9%), slapped (5.4%), verbally abused (2.9%), or talked harshly to (2.5%). 43.8% of the 
working children from Barmer (Rajasthan) reported getting slapped by someone. A very small proportion (0.1%) 
of the children reported getting punched by someone in the place work, this response was reported by children 
from Gaya (Bihar) and Balrampur (UP).

their children spend it on food and clothing, and 44.8% reported that they use it as their pocket money. A very 
small proportion of mothers (7 .4%) said that their children use the money as savings.  However, interestingly, 
100% of the mothers from Jaipur, whose children were working reported that their child keeps the income as 
savings.
Only 7 .7% of mothers from Darbhanga (Bihar) reported that their children used the income to pay dues to his/her

3.3.4.5  nterference of work with other activities
The children’s work interfered with their school attendance, self-study time, and also their sleep cycles.
15.6% of the children or their friends who were engaged in some work, reported that their work interfered with 
their school attendance. The highest proportions of children from Barmer (47 .3%) district of Rajasthan, North 
Parganas (41.9%), and Murshidabad (36.2%) districts of Weste Bengal reported interference of work with school 
attendance. 9% of children also stated interference of work with self-study time. The highest proportions were 
reported from North Praganas (51.6%) and Murshidabad (42.9%).  A small proportion of children (6.5%) across all 
districts reported that the work also affected their sleep. (Refer to T able A.4.20 in Annexure 4)
However, 51.4% reported that there were no negative consequences of child labor on other activities. This 
highlights a greater need for awareness amongst children of the negative effects of working at a younger age.
The qualitative evidence on impact of child labor shows shared awareness on the harmful consequences of 
child labor across states. In West Bengal, the impacts that emerge from the narratives include sex trafficking, 
bonded labor, and urban begging, with concerns about education and future outcomes. In Bihar, children 
discuss a range of consequences, from missed education to health issues including mental and physical 
health. Rajasthan’s FGDs emphasize the loss of normal childhood experiences. In Uttar Pradesh, stakeholders 
universally recognize extensive negative impacts, with children enduring over 10 hours of daily labor.
In West Bengal, CWC officials acknowledge the diverse impact of child labor, ranging from sex trafficking 
in brothels to bonded labor in households and children begging in cities. An official in Jalpaiguri noted that 
children are stuck into labor-intensive jobs, leading some to succumb to drug addiction.
FGD sessions with children in West Bengal highlight the detrimental consequences of child labor, particularly 
its adverse effects on education. Participants express concerns about the future of children engaged in child 
labor, fearing they may be trafficked, drop out of school, or encounter challenges in pursuing their goals. One 
participant stated, “The future is bad.”
In Rajasthan the narratives on adverse effects of child labor emerge from the FGD sessions with children, 
emphasizing that it deprives them of normal childhood experiences. One girl said, “These children are made 
to work in factories, hotels, beg, work at railway stations, and their kidneys are sold.”
In Uttar Pradesh, all stakeholders acknowledge the negative impact of child labor. According to a CWC 
official, such children endure more than 10 hours of labor daily in exhausting environments. FGD findings 
with boys reveal a comprehensive understanding of the detrimental effects of child labor. BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 71

The highest proportion of mothers who reported knowing child trafficking incidence was observed in Murshidabad 
in West Bengal (6.1%). This was followed by Gaya, Bihar (1.56%) (Refer to table 3.4.1). Mothers from various 
districts reported knowing no child who was a victim of child trafficking- Bareilly, Prayagraj, Chandauli, Bharatpur, 
Dungarpur, Jaipur, Jalpaiguri, and Darjeeling. 
The 50 mothers (0.76%) who reported that they knew at least one case of a child who got trafficked in the last 
1 year, were spread across only 23 villages (Refer to T able A.5.12 in Annexure 5). Therefore, out of the total 160 
villages where the survey was conducted, 135 villages had no reporting of any child trafficking cases.
On average mothers were aware of at least 1 boy who was trafficked in the last 1 year.
Stakeholders, during qualitative interviews, highlighted that the challenge of identifying victims and the 
hidden nature of the problem makes it difficult to gain an accurate picture of the trends and prevalence. They 
argued that although the exact figures are unknown, a government stakeholder added,  “We cannot say that 
there are no such cases. But yes, there are fewer cases.” 
One of the reasons for the under-reporting of child trafficking cases highlighted through Interviews with 
key informants, particularly government stakeholders, reveal that trafficking is often confused as child 
labor, making the issue hard to recognize. Government stakeholders shed light on the dire situation faced 
by children. One emphasized, “Children themselves are not aware that they are trafficked, and they do not know 
facts like where they are going, for what reason they are going, and so on. Sometimes the children are told that they 
are going to work, earning money. Their families are trapped and allured by the wicked people or intermediaries 
in the network of child trafficking.”  Another government stakeholder drew attention to the hidden nature of 
the issue, stating, “It’s hidden cases and misled by love affairs, but it’s rapidly increasing day by day.” This 
stakeholder also pointed out the challenges in identification, adding, “The number is increasing in a hidden 
way, which is very difficult to identify.”

Table 3.4.2 shows that the average case of trafficking known by mothers was more for boys, as compared to girls 
(Boys 1.72; Girls 0.38) (Refer to table 3.4.2). The maximum cases of child trafficking were reported by a mother 
from Khandail, Gaya, where she knew 10 boys who were victims of child trafficking. While the cases girls were 
low, Para village from Barmer, had a mother who reported to know 10 girls who were trafficked in the last 1 year.
The highest prevalence rate of trafficking was estimated for Barmer (Rajasthan), where 83.3% of the girls were 
trafficked, and 67% boys. However, it is important to note that only 1 mother from Bramer reported that they 
knew a child who was trafficked in the last 1 year (Refer to table 3.4.3). 
Secondary literature further highlights that there is often reluctance among victims of child trafficking to disclose 
victimization or seek help, because of fear of retribution from the traffickers33 34. This leads to one of the biases 
of the Network-Scale up method which was discussed in the first section- transmission bias. Given child victims 
refuse to disclose their identity, often leads mother not knowing that information about the children in the 
community, because children in the community did not communicate this. 
Limitation in NSUM estimate for lower response rates-  N-SUM, methodologically, calculates the 
prevalence estimates using the census population of the subgroup in question (children aged 18 years and 
below, in the case of this study) While doing so, it does not account for the low response rate therefore making 
it challenging to draw reliable conclusions for very low response rates. 
Overall, stakeholders across the states indicated that issue of child trafficking is on a decline except for those 
districts that share borders with Nepal, where the issue persists. The states had varied responses regarding 
the prevalence of child trafficking, with Bihar experiencing high rates, while Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and 
Rajasthan reported lower occurrences. In Uttar Pradesh, Prayagraj stands out with almost no reported cases of 
trafficking, as indicated by all the stakeholders interviewed. Although there is a decreasing trend in other districts, 
those situated near the Nepal border, like Balarampur, continue to struggle with the issue of child trafficking. 
In Rajasthan, government stakeholders assert that the number of cases is nearly negligible, with no reported 
instances of child trafficking. Bihar faces a concerning situation, particularly in the Sitamarhi district, located near 
the Nepal border, where the incidence of child trafficking is high. A government stakeholder in Bihar stated that, 
“Cases remained high in Sitamarhi but due to awareness, its number is decreasing. Being a border region, its 
number is high here compared to other districts. But we have targeted to decrease it in the future.”

3.4.2 Knowledge and Awareness of trafficking of children 
Only 40.7% of the children have received any information on child trafficking. The most common source of 
information on this was reported to be Television.  The FGDs from children also validate that Television news was 
the most common source of information. 
Districts of West Bengal had the highest proportions of children who had received some information (North 
Parganas 91.7%; Darjeeling 90.5%; Murshidabad 85.6%; Jalpaiguri 82.9%). Low proportions of children from 
Sitamarhi (9.8%), Katihar (16.1%), and Balrampur (18%) knew about child trafficking. (Refer to table A.5.1 in 
Annexure 5).  Th e findings suggest that there is a scope for increasing awareness of child trafficking amongst 
children in the community.
The most common source of information on child trafficking was reported to be Television (54.3%), peers/friends 
(55.2%), teachers/school (49.1%), and parents (47 .6%). Only 3% of the children reported NGO sensitization 
programs as a source of information. 17 .4% of the children also reported community/group discussions, with the 
highest proportion reported in districts of UP- Bareilly (63.8%) and Balrampur (55.4%).
The lowest proportions of children from all districts of West Bengal reported this option (Jalpaiguri 2.1%; North 
Parganas 12.8%; Darjeeling 4.6%; Murshidabad 0.3%).
The qualitative findings reveal that children have good understanding of child trafficking, recognizing it as 
situations where a child is exchanged for money. However, in certain cases, they identify it as child labour. 
Similarly, both children and all stakeholders interviewed had good knowledge and awareness of child 
trafficking issues. The Gram panchayat members are informed about the issue and reported no instances of 
child trafficking in villages.
Respondents identify illiteracy, poverty, and unemployment as the main factors for Child Trafficking though some 
variation in factors emerged across states. Various states have distinct reasons for cases of child trafficking. In 
West Bengal, a prevalent tactic involves luring girls into what appears to be love marriages, only for them 
to become victims of trafficking later on. The rise of social media and widespread mobile phone access has 
been implicated in facilitating such incidents.  In the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, regions that share 
borders with Nepal are grappling with the significant challenge of child trafficking. The proximity to the 
Nepal border has intensified the issue in districts within these states, highlighting a critical concern. An NGO 
personnel mentioned “Sitamarhi district is located on the border of Nepal. So, Bihar government and the 
district administration are actively working to reduce the trafficking cases. The government is organizing 
different program by involving the NGOs to reduce the trafficking cases in the district.” BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 75

3.4.3 Attitudes and Beliefs on trafficking of children 
Mothers and children reported to seek support from Police, in case any child goes missing. 
84.4% of the mothers said they would report a case where the child is found to be missing or kidnapped. The 
highest proportion of mothers from West Bengal reported this (North Parganas 95.9%; Murshidabad 95.6%; 
Jalpaiguri 93.7%; Darjeeling 92.7%). The lowest proportion of mothers from Barmer (59.3%) district of Rajasthan 
stated that they would report a case of missing child. (Refer to figure 3.4.1)
As compared to mothers, a slightly higher proportion of children (91%) across all sampled districts stated that 
they would report or seek help from someone in case any friend of theirs goes missing. In Prayagraj district of UP 
only 77 .3% of children reported doing so. (Refer to table A.5.13 in Annexure 5)
94% of the mothers reported that they would seek support from the police. Other sources of reporting such a 
case was chosen by a small proportion of mothers- AWW/ASHAs (9.4%); child protection committees’ members 
(3.9%); Juvenile police units (1.5%); NGO complaint cells/platforms (0.8%). (Refer to table A.5.14 in Annexure 5). 
Children reported to the police (80%) and parents (55%) the most. Similar to mothers, a small proportion of 
children stated other options such as Juvenile police units (4.3%); child protection committee members (3.4%); 
NGOs (2.3%); NGO cells such as bachpan bachao aandolan (0.2%) to seek support from. (Refer to table A.5.15 
in Annexure 5). 
During focus group discussions with children across all states, when presented with scenarios depicting 
child trafficking, unanimous agreement emerged that such situations are deemed unacceptable under any 
circumstances. The children expressed a strong belief that incidents of child trafficking should be reported to 
the police, unanimously considered the primary choice. Teachers and parents followed as secondary options 
for reporting. Notably, in the states of Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, children displayed a preference for 
reporting to NGOs.

3.4.4 Practices on child trafficking 
3.4.3.1 Migration of children in the past 
Balrampur district of UP had the highest reported prevalence of migration, whereas Bharatpur district of Rajasthan 
had none reported. 
11.3% ( N =  7 4 3  o f  6 5 6 0 ) of the mothers reported that someone in their family has migrated in the past. 7% 
reported that the family members have migrated seasonally, and 4.3% migrated permanently. The highest 
proportion of mothers from Dungarpur (Rajasthan) reported seasonal migration of family members (36.1%). 
Permanent migration was reported the highest in Balrampur (17 .8%) (Refer to table A.5.4 in Annexure 5). On 
the contrary, none of the mothers surveyed from the Bharatpur district of Rajasthan reported any incidence of 
migration in the family. 
A comparatively higher proportion of mothers from districts of UP and Bihar reported migration of children from 
their families. 
Of those mothers who reported an incidence of migration in the family, 21.7% (N= 161 of 743) of them reported 
migration of children from the family. The highest proportion of mothers from Katihar (Bihar) (46.4%), Bareilly 
(UP) (43.8%), Gaya (Bihar) (36%), and Balrampur (UP) (34.2%) reported that children from their families migrated. 
(Refer to table A.5.5 in Annexure 5).
Overall, nearly 90% (n =145) of the mothers who reported that the children in the family migrated reported the 
search of employment as one of the top reasons for their migration. 
Balrampur (83.6%), Bareilly (100%), and Katihar (100%) had the highest prevalence of mothers who reported 
that the children in their family had migrated in search of employment/better employment. (Refer to table A.5.15 
in Annexure 5).
A government stakeholder said, “I have seen in my tenure that rescued children bring bangle boxes for their mothers 
or sisters from the destination. I was amused by the fact that the child is getting trafficked for working in these bangle 
factories and he/she brings back the bangles made by him for his family members.”  This powerful observation 
exposes the disturbing practices of child trafficking and the intertwined nature of exploitation woven into 
the lives of these vulnerable individuals.BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 77

3.4.3.2 Help provided to children during migration for employment opportunities (N = 145) 
In the majority of cases, a family member or a friend helped the child to migrate for employment opportunities.  
72.4% (N=105 of 145) of the mothers reported that someone helped their children migrate to seek employment 
opportunities. 61% of the mothers reported that a friend helped their child to migrate. A small proportion of 
mothers (3.8%) reported an employer or potential employers helped their child to migrate. This was only reported 
in three districts (One mother from Bareilly (UP) and 3 from Dungarpur (Rajasthan) reported this). (Figure 3.4.2).
42.9% of the mothers whose child was helped by someone reported that the child owes money to that person. 
The highest proportion of mothers from Katihar (Bihar) (67 .9%; 19 mothers) and Balrampur (UP) (40.5%; 17 
mothers) reported this. 
3.4.3.3 Migration of children in the future 
A relatively higher proportion of mothers from Balrampur, Katihar, and Bareilly reported that the children of the 
household have plans to migrate soon to look for employment activities.  
A small proportion (7 .9%; n = 521) of mothers across all sampled districts reported that someone in their family 
has plans to migrate in the near future. The highest proportions were reported from districts of UP and Bihar- 
Balrampur (33.4%; n =137), followed by Bareilly (23.9%; n = 98), and Katihar (19.5%; n = 80). (Refer to table 
A.5.8 in Annexure 5). Of those mothers who reported plans for future migration, 43.8% (n = 228) reported that 
children from the family will migrate. In Bareilly, 64.3% of the mothers (n = 63) reported that their children have 
plans for future migration. (Refer to table A.5.9 in Annexure 5).
Interestingly, 81.14% (n = 185) of the mothers who reported that their children have plans for future migration, 
stated one of their reasons for migration as employment opportunities. 100% of the mothers in Bareilly (n =63) 
and Katihar (n= 43) reported this. (Refer to table A.5.10 in Annexure 5).

3.5 Child Sexual Abuse
3.5.1 Prevalence of Child Sexual Abuse
The highest proportion of mothers from Bihar reported knowing at least one child who was a victim of child 
sexual abuse in the last year
1.2% (84) of the mothers reported knowing at least 1 or more children, who were victims of child sexual abuse 
in the last one year. The highest proportions of these mothers belonged from the districts of Bihar- Sitamarhi 
(8.2%); Gaya (2.2%); and Katihar (1.2%). 
Out of the 16 districts, mothers from 6 districts reported to know no child who was a victim of sexual abuse (refer 
to table 3.5.1). Therefore, out of the 160 villages, 129 villages had no reporting of child sexual abuse cases. (Refer 
to table A.6.13 in Annexure 6)
Observations from the field during the survey highlighted that one of the reasons for the underreporting of 
child sexual abuse cases was the reluctance of mothers to discuss such sensitive issues. They might be afraid of 
being judged or treated badly if they share their own experiences or talk about someone else’s experiences. 35  
Consequently, response rates to personal questions tend to decline as the sensitivity of the topic increases36 37 .
KEY FINDINGS
• 1.2% (84) mothers reported knowing at least 1 or more children who were victims of child sexual 
abuse in the last year. 
• Out of the 160 villages, 129 villages had no reporting of any case of sexual abuse.
• Only 6.5% of the mothers were aware of the POCSO act. 
• 56.6% of the mothers reported that they have spoken to their children about sexual abuse, whereas 
only 36.4% of the children reported that their parents have spoken to them about this. 
• The lowest proportion of children disagreed with the notion that- ‘only girls are victims of sexual abuse’ 
(22.3%) and ‘most perpetrators of child sexual abuse do not belong to the child’s family’ (48.3%).

The maximum cases of child sexual abuse amongst boys and girls were reported from Bhogbhita, Darjeeling; 
Kolhuai Binauni, Balrampur; and Pandila, Prayagraj. In all these three villages, a mother reported to know 3 boys 
and 3 girls who were victims of child sexual abuse.  (Refer to table A.6.13 in Annexure 6)
T able 3.5.3 shows the N-SUM estimates of the child sexual abuse cases across the districts where the mothers 
reported knowing at least 1 child who was a victim of child sexual abuse. The highest prevalence rate of child 
sexual abuse was in Sitamarhi (Boys 2%; Girls 1.5%). 
Another reason for a low response rate on child sexual abuse could be because of the Transmission bias of the 
N-SUM method. Some mothers may genuinely be unaware of any instances of child abuse. Child sexual abuse 
often remains hidden because children are scared to talk about their experiences. They worry about getting in 
trouble or being judged. Children who face sexual abuse, also have a fear of retribution39 40. They fear what might 
happen to them, and their families if they reveal the abuse. Therefore, in such cases, the respondents (mothers) 
who are being interviewed are not aware of any such case in the community, which leads to low response rates 
for such sensitive issues.

The Qualitative data, particularly from Government officials present a contradicting picture on the prevalence of child 
sexual abuse- whether the cases are increasing or decreasing . Officials from DWCD, NGO, and CWC claim that 
the number is increasing drastically. Some government officials claim that the frequency of these cases is the 
same, but the number of cases only seems to be increasing because more of them are being reported now 
compared to in the past. They estimate roughly, “230 to 250 reports every year”, whereas another official claims 
to have seen as little as only four cases in the past five years. Another batch of Govt officials, particularly 
representatives from DLSU and DCPU feel the numbers are decreasing. According to Govt representative, 
“there is no question of increasing them and the government and administration people are working well behind this”. 
Another remarked, “People become more aware now, so these types of cases have been decreasing.”
39. The fear of retribution or harm in the context of survey participation refers to individuals’ concerns about potential negative consequences they might face if they 
disclose sensitive information, particularly regarding the experiences of others. This fear can act as a significant deterrent, preventing individuals from openly sharing 
their knowledge or awareness of sensitive issues

3.5.2 Knowledge and Awareness of Child Sexual Abuse
Mothers were slightly more aware of child sexual abuse, as opposed to children. Mothers from Rajasthan and 
children from Bihar had the lowest awareness.
More than half of the surveyed mothers (53.3%) mentioned that they were aware that children can be subjected 
to sexual abuse/ harassment. This proportion was low for all four districts in Rajasthan with Bharatpur district 
having the lowest prevalence (17 .6%) (Refer to T able A.6.1 in Annexure 6). A low proportion of children (35.6%) 
reported having heard of sexual abuse. The lowest proportion of children was from Chandauli (UP) (9%) and 
Sitamarhi (Bihar) (9.3%) while the highest proportion was observed from North Parganas (West Bengal). (Refer 
to T able A.6.2 in Annexure 6). 
Only 6.5% of mothers across all districts reported knowing about the POSCO Act (Protection of Children from 
Sexual Offence). However, other government stakeholders had a good understanding of child sexual abuse and 
understood the significance of the POCSO act as well.
In districts Bharatpur (Rajasthan) and Katihar (Bihar) no respondents were aware of the POSCO Act. The highest 
prevalence was seen for the districts of West Bengal, Jalpaiguri, and Darjeeling with a prevalence of 24.9% and 
20% respectively.  (Refer to T able A.6.3 in Annexure 6). 
The voices of children reflect an awareness of touch. The understanding extends to recognizing the details 
of physical contact in some children. “If our friends, our teachers hug us or shake our hands, then it is a good 
touch,” they express, highlighting a clarity that resonates in their definitions of good and bad touch. In Bihar, 
a child succinctly defines good and bad touch during an IDI, “Good touch refers to safe, appropriate physical 
contact, like hugs from loved ones, promoting comfort and trust. Bad touch involves unwanted or harmful 
contact, causing discomfort or fear, such as hitting or inappropriate advances.” This comprehension extends 
to personal boundaries, with an acknowledgment that boundaries may vary, but intimate areas should not 
be touched without consent. Yet, the narrative isn’t uniform even within the state. In some Bihar FGDs, 
hesitancy emerges, with one interviewer expressing concern that “the students were not aware much and 
were hesitant to speak on this. “Shyness becomes a barrier, as highlighted by another interviewer who notes, 
“Children know but feel shy to discuss.”82 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM

Government entities, such as the District Legal Services Authority in Bihar, demonstrate a good understanding 
of the issue. They recognize that child sexual abuse extends beyond physical trauma to intentional sexual acts, 
inappropriate remarks, and exploitation. They cite UNICEF statistics, emphasizing the prevalence of sexual 
abuse among adolescent girls and the significance of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act 
(POCSO) in combating such crimes.
A government official points out that, “Teasing girls, good touch or bad touch, or giving dirty glances, all this is 
child sexual abuse.” Another Government official said, “Child sexual abuse (CSA), also known as child molestation, 
is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent uses a child for sexual stimulation. Types of child sexual 
abuse include engaging in sexual activity with a child (whether by asking or forcing, or grooming a child in other ways), 
and child sexual abuse, such as using a child to make child pornography. Different types of child sexual abuse Child 
marriage is one of the main forms of child sexual exploitation”
Less mothers were able to identify different actions, which constituted child sexual abuse.
Less than 30% of the mothers across all districts, identified behaviors like pulling a child’s clothes to expose their 
body or underwear (21.3%), or someone showing their private parts to a child (20.8%) as child sexual abuse. This 
proportion was lowest for all four districts in Uttar Pradesh. (Refer to A.6.4 in Annexure 6).
The lowest identified behavior as sexual abuse by children was physical or verbal exposure to sexual intercourse 
(28.6% of children). This prevalence was lowest for district Katihar in Bihar (1.7%)
Kissing or touching the child forcefully was the most identified child sexual abuse behavior by mothers (68.8%) 
as well as children (82.9%). More than 90% of the mothers in districts Sitamarhi (Bihar) (96.3%) and Bharatpur 
(Rajasthan) (95.8%) identified the same (Refer to A.6.4 in Annexure 6). This prevalence was highest for children 
for Jalpaiguri (94%) and Darjeeling (93.9%) districts of West Bengal.
These findings indicate a need for enhanced awareness among mothers as well as children in the sampled districts 
regarding child sexual abuse behaviours, particularly in UP .

The perceptions of stakeholders present a disconcerting narrative on the broad spectrum of perpetrators. 
A Bihar official emphasizes the inhumane mentality of perpetrators. A West Bengal official notes that male 
elders, aged 55 and above, often family members, engage in crimes for money. Perpetrators extend to 
teachers, neighbours, and individuals like truck drivers, as highlighted by another West Bengal official. An 
NGO staff that fa revealed that familial perpetrators, particularly male elders, may resort to blackmail and 
threats.
One government official from Bihar emphasizes the inhumane mentality among perpetrators, regardless 
familial ties, these individuals, as noted, can be found both within families and outside. The official states, 
“There are some inhumane people in society. They can be in the family or from outside.”  Close relatives, such as 
uncles, maternal uncles, and neighbours, are frequently identified as the primary perpetrators of sexual abuse 
against young children by some authorities. 
According to a government official, minors, particularly those from illiterate families, may unwittingly become 
offenders due to a lack of awareness about legal actions and provisions. The official says, “They are not aware 
of the legal action, acts provision. They come from illiterate families.”
One official believed that, male elders within families are reported to be engaging in these crimes in exchange 
for money. A government official from West Bengal specifies, “Predators are mostly men who are above the 
age of 55, who molest, rape, and are mostly family members.” For some, Perpetrators extend beyond familial 
circles to include teachers, neighbours, and individuals such as truck drivers, drug addicts, and criminals, as 
pointed out by a government official from West Bengal. The lack of education is highlighted as an additional 
risk factor.

Friends, social media, and teachers were the most common sources of information for children on sexual abuse.
Friends/acquaintances (69.4%) and social media (60.1%) were the top two sources from where children heard 
about sexual abuse. A relatively lower proportion of children also reported hearing about the same from their 
parents (31.5%) and teachers (41.1%) or cousins/siblings (19.7%). (Refer to the T able A.6.5 Annexure table 6)
A lower proportion of children confirmed that their mothers/parents had spoken to them about sexual abuse. 
More than 55% of the surveyed mothers reported that they have spoken to their children about sexual abuse. 
(Refer to T able A.6.11 in Annexure 6). This proportion was highest for district Prayagraj (94.2%) in Uttar Pradesh. 
As compared to mothers a relatively lower proportion of children across all districts reported that their parents 
have ever talked to them about sexual abuse (36.4%).  Refer to Table A.6.6 Annexure 6). Interestingly, for children 
as well, the highest proportion was noted from district Prayagraj (59.1%). 
More than 50% of the surveyed children reported that they have been told about sexual abuse at school or by 
a teacher (52.3%) (Refer to T able A.6.7 Annexure 6). This proportion was highest for all four sampled districts 
in Rajasthan with Bharatpur (99%) having the maximum prevalence of children reporting the same. The lowest 
prevalence of children from Murshidabad (West Bengal) (12.6%) reported being told about sexual abuse at school 
or by the teacher.

The finding suggests a scope for increased conversations around sexual abuse at home and in schools.
While mothers taught their children about behaviours with strangers, knowledge on good touch and bad touch 
remained low.
Mothers (56.6%) who reported speaking to their children about sexual abuse, were asked about the specific points 
they discussed during the conversation.  The highest proportion of mothers across all districts advised children 
to not go out with strangers (79.3%). This proportion was high for all the sampled districts in Uttar Pradesh and 
Rajasthan with all mothers in Bharatpur (100%) discussing the same. The lowest proportion of mothers from 
Murshidabad (West Bengal) (47 .3%) discussed this with their children. 
Apart from this a relatively lower proportion of mothers (44.8%) across all districts reported teaching their 
children about good touch and bad touch. This percentage was lowest for districts Balrampur and Bareilly where 
only 3.7% and 0.9% of mothers respectively reported the same  (Refer to Table A.6.14 in Annexure 6).. The other 
discussion points reported by mothers with lower proportions include discussions around not letting anyone 
touch private parts (24.9%), encouraging the children to speak about such incidents if any, not keeping any secrets 
(28%), providing them with books or audio-visual aids for sexual abuse prevention (12.2%) (Refer to Table 3.5.4)
As being aware of the existence of sexual abuse, helps children understand what it is and recognize inappropriate 
behaviour, the findings suggest a scope for more discussions between children and their mothers regarding the 
same.  
One government official remarked, “Somewhere the family system is also at fault. In society, if people keep their 
children well informed and aware, and keep them within the boundaries of culture, then it will have a positive impact.” 
Many believed that families serve as the first school for many young children, shaping their norms and culture 
as they grow up. Therefore, it is imperative for families to educate their children about such sensitive topics.

Perspectives on causes reveal a complex interplay of societal, familial, and technological factors. Government officials, 
NGOs, and community stakeholders contribute diverse insights, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of this 
pervasive Child Sexual Abuse issue.
CSA is linked to various societal issues, as one government official mentions, “Child sexual abuse is 
connected due to lack of socialization, parenting, family background, psychological disorder, lack of humanity, 
psychological issues, revenge, sex addiction, pornography.” “Another official points to the impact of technology, 
emphasizing that the main reasons for child sexual abuse include the widespread availability of phones.” A government 
official shared that the societal trend among young teenagers to elope and run away exacerbates the issues 
of child sexual abuse. A government official from Uttar Pradesh expressed, “Girls run away with boys, and they 
are brainwashed. This happens through chatting also.”  Social media addiction, increased demand, and mental 
disorders are also highlighted as contributing factors. “The main reasons for child sexual abuse in today’s society 
are internet, mobile facility, every person in every house having a phone and leaving the phone in the hands of children. 
In this way, teenage girls become victims.”
In Bihar, officials identify drugs and poverty as the primary reasons for child sexual abuse. According to an 
official, the lack of resources at home leads girls to vulnerable situations, such as “going to farms for nature’s 
calls, making them targets for perpetrators”. The lack of fear instilled in potential offenders is also recognized as 
a cause.
In Rajasthan, the narrative expands to attitudes and beliefs. An NGO representative attributes the increase 
in child sexual abuse to societal stigmas and the lack of open conversations about sex and sexuality. They 
emphasize the impact of conservative thinking and avoidance of open discussions on sex-related topics, 
pushing children towards seeking information on the internet, where negative content often dominates. “The 
reason behind this is the mentality of the people... If you write the word sex, you will get 10% good things and mostly 
negative things, then instead of that 10% coming to the child’s attention, 90% comes to the child’s attention, and the 
child will try to try things in a wrong way.”
Government officials from Uttar Pradesh attribute child sexual abuse to a combination of factors. They point 
to bad mentality, the influence of modern technologies, readily available offensive online content, and love 
affairs of girls as contributing elements. Teenage love affairs are highlighted as a major reason, and the lack of 
surveillance and monitoring of children’s mobile phone usage is emphasized.BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 87

3.5.3 Attitudes and Beliefs related to Child Sexual Abuse
Overall, the attitudes concerning sexual abuse amongst mothers highlighted a scope for greater awareness and 
shift in attitudes, especially in the context of beliefs around sexual abuse education.
|Overall, across the 16 sampled districts, the composite score for attitudes on sexual abuse for mothers was 0.40. 
Only 28.2% of the mothers reported disagreeing with the notion that child sexual abuse prevention education 
may induce your child to know too much about sex (Refer to T able 3.5.5). The composite score for attitudes and 
beliefs of mothers related to child sexual abuse is lowest in Bharatpur (0.17). The highest compositive score was 
observed from Murshidabad (0.71). 
A high proportion of mothers across all districts agreed with the notions that Child Sexual Abuse prevention 
education in school is necessary (92.8%), Body safety rules (good touch/bad touch) should be taught to the 
child at primary level (91.7%) and Strict legal punishment will create prevention of Child sexual abuse (90.7%). 
However, a relatively lower proportion of mothers from Darjeeling (West Bengal) agreed with these statements 
showcasing positive attitudes. (refer to Table 3.5.5)
Across all 16 districts, the lowest proportion of children disagreed with the notion that- ‘only girls are victims of 
sexual abuse’ (22.3%) and ‘most perpetrators of child sexual abuse do not belong to the child’s family’ (48.3%). That 
is the maximum, agreed with these notions, showcasing a need for shift in attitudes and beliefs in this regard. (refer 
to Table 3.5.6)
It can be observed that a high proportion of children across all districts reported believing that Educating children 
on sexual abuse is necessary to prevent Child Sexual Abuse (95.3%), Child sexual abuse prevention education 
should be a part of the school curriculum (96.3%) and Child sexual abuse prevention education should be a part of 
the College curriculum (95.5%). Across all the sampled districts, a very low proportion of children disagreed with 
the notion that only girls are a victim of sexual abuse. This proportion was lowest for 24 North Parganas (West 
Bengal) where only 7 .5% of children disagreed with the same, showcasing the need for improvement in attitudes 
in the district. 
A high proportion of children across districts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar agreed with the notion that youth can 
play a big role in preventing Child Sexual Abuse in their locality. This prevalence was lowest for Murshidabad 
district (36%) in West Bengal. Additionally, it is interesting to note that in Murshidabad, less proportion of children 
disagreed with the notions that it is embarrassing to discuss issues related to sex (36%) and that most perpetrators 
of child sexual abuse do not belong to the child’s family (34.5%). Royal Blue Golden Yellow

A higher proportion of mothers would report the case of sexual abuse to the police, whereas a higher proportion of 
children would advise their friends to seek help from parents.
Across all the sample districts, 65% of mothers reported that if they found out about any child sexual abuse case in 
their community, they would report it. This prevalence was the lowest for Dungarpur (31%) and Barmer (38.3%) 
districts of Rajasthan. Refer to T able A.6.9 in Annexure 6.
The highest proportion of mothers mentioned that they would report the case to the Police (95.5%), followed by 
Gram panchayats (32.9%) and AWWs/ASHAs (10.4%). A very small proportion of mothers mentioned reporting 
the case to Juvenile Police Units (2%), NGOs/Complaint Cells (1.3%), Health Centres (1.6%), Child Protection 
Committee members (5.5%) and NCRB (0.2%). Out of 5.5% of mothers who mentioned reporting the case to 
Child Protection Committee members, the highest proportion (21.5%) was noted from Murshidabad (West 
Bengal). Refer to T able A.6.9 in Annexure 6.
Juvenile Police and CPCs play an important role in taking immediate action, the findings suggest a need for 
educating the mothers on the importance of these institutions.
Children were asked about what they would do if a friend confided in them about experiencing sexual abuse. 
The highest proportion of children mentioned that they would advise a friend to share the concern with parents 
(67 .3%), followed by advising them to stay away from the abuser (45.2%) and visit the Police Station to report the 
case (39.9%) (Refer to table 3.5.8). A very low proportion of children from Katihar (3.4%) reported that they would 
report the case to the police. However, the highest proportion of children who reported the same belonged to 
district 24 Praganas North (59.7%). 
Other responses with a low prevalence include sharing the concern with a friend (29.8%), sharing with the teacher 
(20.4%), confronting the abuser (1.8%), and informing the police by calling 100 (25.9%). (Refer to T able A.6.10 in

3.6 Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation
3.6.1 Prevalence of Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation
Across all the study locations, reporting of child online sexual abuse and exploitation remained low. One of the 
reasons possible reasons for this could be lack of awareness amongst mothers. 
0.3% of the mothers (21 mothers) reported that they know at least one child who had faced online sexual abuse 
and exploitation in the last year. More than 50% of the districts had no reporting of any case of online sexual 
abuse (Bareilly, Chandauli, Bharatpur, Dungarpur, Barmer, Jaipur, Murshidabad, Darbhanga, and Katihar).
KEY FINDINGS
• Only 0.3% (21) of mothers reported knowing a child who was a victim of online abuse.
• More than 75% of households had access to smartphones and the Internet. 67% of the children had 
internet access. 
• The most common way of monitoring the use of the internet reported by both mothers and children 
was when the parents checked the device to see what the child was doing (mothers 89.6%; children 
62.2%). 
• 5.6% (23) of mothers reported that their children were abused online. The highest proportions were 
reported from districts of Bihar (Gaya 1.2%; Sitamarhi 1%; Darbhanga 1%).92 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM

Secondary literature and the findings in the prevailing sections highlight two possible reasons for the low reporting 
of online abuse and exploitation cases against children:
Lack of Awareness: The below sections on knowledge and attitudes on online sexual abuse highlight how parents 
(mothers in our case) are not completely aware of what their children do on the internet. Secondary literature further 
shows that parents and caregivers might not fully understand the digital platforms and social media sites that their 
children use. As a result, they may not be aware of potential dangers or how to navigate online privacy settings.45
Social stigma: Similar to cases of child sexual abuse, children often don’t disclose their experiences of online 
sexual abuse. In some cultures, discussing issues related to sexual abuse can be considered taboo. Victims may 
feel societal pressure to keep such incidents secret to avoid judgment and preserve the family’s reputation. 46 
Therefore, this leads to a transmission bias, where mothers are not aware of such incidents happening in the 
community, for them to further report it.
The government and NGOs both acknowledge the issue of OCSEA. A government stakeholder emphasized, 
“It is one of the pressing issues we are currently confronting,” showcasing the gravitas of the problem and 
awareness about the issue. 
In West Bengal, concerns regarding the increasing prevalence of online child sexual exploitation and abuse 
(OCSEA) were shared by both government and non-government groups. Non-government organizations 
emphasized the underreporting of cases despite a discernible increase, while government officials linked 
OCSEA to a surge in suicides and drug abuse. In Bihar, conflicting views emerged, with NGOs asserting a 
rise in cases linked to increased social media use. Acknowledging the rising trend, a government stakeholder 
stated, “Yes, the number of child trafficking cases is increasing. In my opinion, there are several reasons behind it. For 
example, the easy availability of mobile/smart phones to children and their unrestricted access to information and 
undesired content on the internet. Televisions and other viable mediums can also be factors for the same.”
This contrasted with the perspectives of government, local leaders, and school managers, who credited strict 
laws and heightened parental awareness, claiming either a decline in numbers or a lack of observed cases. 
Rajasthan witnessed a consensus among stakeholders who asserted a decrease in OCSEA cases, with a 
notable emphasis on robust awareness programs. Uttar Pradesh exhibited a divergence of opinions among 
stakeholders on the prevalence of OCSEA, with some pointing towards underreporting due to familial 
prestige, yet local authorities believed in a downward trend. 
In Uttar Pradesh, stakeholders also differed on the prevalence, with some citing underreporting due to the 
prestige and reputation of families. Interestingly, the gram panchayat and School Management Committees 
(SMCs) in Uttar Pradesh expressed a belief that OCSEA cases were decreasing.94 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM

3.6.2 Practices related to the usage of the internet in the household
Murshidabad (96.8%) and North Parganas (95.1%) in West Bengal had the highest percentage of households 
with smartphone and internet access. 
More than 75% of households had smartphones available in their households. The lowest prevalence of 
households having smartphones were from Sitamarhi (42.4%) and Darbhanga (46.8%) districts of Bihar.
Overall, 78.4% of the mothers reported the availability of the Internet in their households. The highest proportion 
of households from Murshidabad (West Bengal) (96.8%) had internet. This was followed by North Parganas (West 
Bengal) (95.4%) and Bharatpur (Rajasthan) (95.1%). The lowest proportion of households having internet access 
was noted in Sitamarhi (41.5%) and Darbhanga (46.1%) districts of Bihar. (Refer to table A.7 .1 in Annexure 7)
Even though households had internet availability, a relatively lower percentage of children were given access to the 
internet in the household. 
More than 2/3rd of the mothers (67 .7%) reported that their children had access to the Internet on a device in the 
household. 94.1% of the mothers from Murshidabad (West Bengal) reported that their children had access to 
the internet. While more than 90% of the households in North Parganas (West Bengal) had internet within the 
household, only 82.7% of the mothers reported that their children also had access to the internet. Mothers from 
Bihar- Sitamarhi (38.3%) and Darbhanga (40.5%) reported the lowest percentage of children having access to the 
internet in the household. 
A similar internet access trend was self-reported by children, where 66.5% of the children said that they had access 
to the Internet. Children from Murshidabad (92.2%) had the highest reported percentage, whereas the lowest 
percentages were reported from Darbhanga (47 .6%) and Sitamarhi (34.1%). (Refer to table A.7 .4 in Annexure 7)
As per the mothers, the most common use of the internet by their children was for educational purposes. However, 
children reported social media as the most reported use of the internet. The mothers were not completely aware of 
what children do on the phone/internet. 
More than 50% of the mothers reported that their children used the Internet for educational purposes (64.6%) and 
to play games (58.8%). The highest proportion of mothers from the Sitamarhi (91.2%) district of Bihar reported 
the use of the Internet for educational purposes, whereas only 24.3% of the mothers in Balrampur (Rajasthan) 
reported this. The highest proportion of the mothers who reported that their children use the Internet for playing 
games was from the Sitamarhi (Bihar) (91%). The lowest proportion was reported from Chandauli (UP) (38%).

Similar to mothers, 63.1% of the children reported that they use the Internet for education purposes and this 
proportion was highest in Darjeeling (West Bengal) (82%). The lowest proportion was noted in Bareilly (31.2%) 
district in Uttar Pradesh. 59% also reported playing games using the internet. However, contrary to the mothers’ 
responses in the Sitamarhi district (Bihar), the lowest proportion of children reported playing games on the internet.
The majority of children (87 .1%) reported that they use the internet to access social media. Social media usage 
was consistently high across all surveyed districts. In contrast to this, a much lower proportion of mothers (56.8%) 
reported that children use the internet to access social media. ((Refer to table A.7 .6 in Annexure 7))
YouTube, WhatsApp, and Facebook were the top three social media platforms used by children.
Other social media platforms used by children were Instagram (33.7%), Snapchat (11.6%), and OTT platforms 
(such as Amazon Prime, etc.) (7 .7%). ((Refer to table A.7 .7 in Annexure 7))
A slightly higher proportion of mothers (55.2%) reported that they supervised children’s internet usage, as compared 
to children (46.1%) themselves.

The highest proportion of mothers from Gaya (90.5%) and Sitamarhi (93.6%) districts of Bihar, reported 
supervising their child’s internet usage. The lowest proportions were reported from Dungarpur (26.7%) and 
Bareilly (33.7%) districts from Uttar Pradesh. ((Refer to table A.7 .8 in Annexure 7)). A similar trend was observed 
in the responses of children. More than 75% of the children from districts of Bihar reported that their parents 
supervise their internet usage (Gaya (84.4%) Sitamarhi (86.4%) Darbhanga (77 .4%)). The lowest proportions were 
reported from Bareilly (20.3%), Dungarpur (11.3%), and Balrampur (33.5%). ((Refer to table A.7 .9 in Annexure 7)).
Difference in responses of mothers and children on monitoring internet usage were observed.
A high percentage of mothers (89.6%) reported that they supervised their child’s internet usage by just going 
to the child and checking their device to see what they were doing on it.  While in most districts, 80% or more 
mothers reported doing this, a few exceptions were Darbhanga (Bihar) (69.3%), North Parganas (West Bengal) 
(76%), Jalpaiguri (West Bengal) (76.3%), Chandauli (UP) (79.5%), and Murshidabad (West Bengal) (79.2%). Similar 
to mothers, a high percentage of children (62.2%) reported that parents used to come and check their devices to 
see what they were doing. (Refer to Annexure A. 7 .27).
Another commonly reported monitoring mechanism was associated with setting up rules in the household to limit 
the number of hours of internet usage (Mothers 17 .5%; Children 23.9%). A few other methods of supervising 
internet usage were limiting the rules for which the internet can be used (mothers 15.7%; children 9%) and 
the use of software/filters that monitor what the child sees online (mothers 10.2%; children 17 .6%) (Refer to 
Annexure A. 7 .27).
All stakeholders perceived parental irresponsibility and lack of supervision as the primary drivers. The misuse of social 
media, pornography addiction, easy access of mobile phones & internet, are also stated as causes. 
In the assessment provided by stakeholders, parents consistently emerge as the main figures responsible for 
the inadequate supervision of their children’s internet activities. This perspective is rooted in various factors, 
including concerns about the misuse of social media, the rise of pornography addiction, and the prevalence of 
mobile phones and internet access.
One government stakeholder emphasized, “It’s rapidly increasing. The cause is due to phone addiction, social media 
sharing explicit content, and children being technology friendly. It’s difficult for parents to track their mobile phones, 
online games, and social media. This gives children an easy mode of communication and the opportunity to earn.”
The improper use of social media is a notable concern, including problems like inappropriate online interactions, 
exposure to harmful content, and the risk of online bullying. Another concern is pornography addiction, where 
parents are seen as essential in tackling this challenge. Since explicit content is easily accessible on the internet, 
there’s an expectation that parents should play an active role in supervising and regulating their children’s 
online activities to shield them from age-inappropriate materials. Adding to these reasons, a member from a 
local community said, “Parents, busy earning a living, often don’t keep an eye on their kids. Nowadays, everything is 
online, and parents can’t always tell if their kids are studying or just wasting time.”BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 97

3.6.3 Knowledge and Awareness on Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation
A relatively higher proportion of children (50.3%), as compared to mothers (46.2%), reported that the internet can 
cause a threat to privacy and security. 
The baseline survey defines privacy and security in the following way:
Privacy: Assurance that the confidentiality and access of certain information related to a person is protected.
Security: State of being protected against the potential threats and dangers over the internet.
The highest proportions of mothers from West Bengal- Murshidabad (88%) and 24 Parganas North (83.7%) 
reported that as per their view, the Internet can cause a threat to privacy and security of an individual. Only a small 
proportion of mothers from Bharatpur (7 .6%) and Bareilly (4.6%) reported so. (Refer to table A.7 .10 in Annexure 7). 
Similar to mothers, the highest proportion of children from the Murshidabad (87%) and 24 Parganas North (83.4%) 
districts in West Bengal reported this. In contrast, Bharatpur (11.9%) and Prayagraj (19.9%) districts from Uttar 
Pradesh had the lowest proportion of children who reported that the Internet can cause a threat to a person’s 
privacy and security. (Refer to table A.7 .11 in Annexure 7)

When it came to online child sexual abuse, different groups, including the government and non-government 
organizations, held different attitudes and beliefs. A group representing members from non-governmental 
organizations perceived that everyone shared the blame for this issue. They pointed fingers at the creators 
of dating apps, stating they were solely interested in making money. They also believed that users who utilized 
these apps released their anger through them and dealt with mental problems. On the other hand, a government 
representative was concerned about kids using phones. They believed that despite being tech-savvy, children 
might have been getting into trouble online. Another stakeholder highlighted the impact of social media on young 
minds. They said, “The girls are being made to watch content that will get them interested in guys after getting in 
contact on social media. Off the record, this happened, but we did not receive any kind of information on this.” This 
statement suggested a concern about inappropriate content manipulating young people through online platforms.
As compared to children (65.6%), A relatively higher proportion of mothers (73.8%) reported that children can be 
sexually abused or exploited online.
The highest proportion of mothers from Sitamarhi (93.3%, n= 238) and North Praganas (85.4%, n = 293) reported 
that a child can be sexually exploited or abused online. Whereas Prayagraj (5.6%, n= 9) and Bharatpur (36.8%, n 
= 7) had the lowest proportions of mothers to report this. 
The highest proportion of children from Darbhanga (92.5%, n= 136), Jalpaiguri (87 .6%, n= 148), and North 
Praganas (83.6%, n = 240) reported that a child can be sexually abused or exploited online. Whereas in Bareilly 
( 14.8%, n= 8) and Balrampur ( 15%, n= 12), the lowest proportions of children reported this. (Refer to table A.7 . 
13 in Annexure 7)
Viewing a pornographic website, receiving sexually explicit content, and being shown sexually explicit content 
were constituted as online abuse and exploitation by a relatively higher majority of mothers and children.

Both mothers and children reported receiving sexually explicit content (mothers 30.2%; children 50.7%) and being 
shown sexually explicit images or videos without permission (mothers 37 .1%; children 54.7%) as online sexual 
abuse and exploitation. 
It was interesting to note that, among both mothers and children, a high proportion reported that viewing a 
pornographic website constitutes as online abuse and exploitation (Mothers 44.8%; children 55.1%). The highest 
proportion of mothers from Bareilly (69.2%) and Sitamarhi (71%) reported this, and a high proportion of children 
reporting this were noted from Bareilly (87 .5%) and Murshidabad (76.7%). ((Refer to table A.7 .14 in Annexure 7)) 
(Refer to table A.7 .15 in Annexure 7)
The majority of the children were aware that a case of online abuse could be reported to police. However, their 
awareness on other platforms for reporting remained low, indicating scope for awareness.
96 . 8% (N= 14 39) of the children repor ted that if someone is sexually exploited online, they can file a police complaint . 
When children were asked if they knew any online platforms or helplines to report online abuse cases, the most 
reported response was for cyber cell (95.4%). Awareness about other platforms was very low- government online 
crime reporting portal (5.9%), Cyber Crime Prevention Against Women and Children (2.6%), and POCSO e-box 
(3.2%) ((Refer to table A.7 .17 in Annexure 7)).
44.9% of the mothers spoke their children on different aspects such as sharing of personal information, responding 
to offensive messages etc.to ensure awareness of online abuse
The highest proportion of mothers from Rajasthan reported doing so (Bharatpur (94.7%); Dungarpur (84.7%); 
Barmer (79.2%); and Jaipur (62.6%). The lowest proportions were noted from UP- Balrampur (15.5%) and 
Chandauli (16.5%).

While nearly 40% of the mothers reported to discuss about chatting with strangers with their children, a very small 
percentage of mothers discussed about responding to message that are mean or nasty (29.2%) and responding 
to any sexually explicit content (19.2%). Dungarpur district of Rajasthan had a consistently high proportion of 
mothers who discussed other issues with their children as well- Chatting with strangers on the internet (90.3%), 
responding to messages that are offensive or nasty (84.7%) and responding to any sexually explicit content or 
materials (66.7%). Contrary to Dungarpur, Balrampur and Bareilly consistently had a low proportion of mothers 
discussing different issues with their children ((Refer to table A.7 .18 in Annexure 7)).The findings on awareness 
around online sexual abuse suggest the need for greater awareness on reporting mechanisms and platforms. 
3.6.3 Attitudes Related to online child sexual abuse and exploitation
In all 16 surveyed districts, the majority of children (81.1%) reported that they would advise their friends or peers 
to delete or block the person if they face online child sexual abuse. 
Nearly 40% of the children indicated that they would advise the person to stop contacting them or advise the 
person to change their privacy settings. In contrast, a small proportion of children reported that they would 
advise their friend to report the incident to a non-government online portal or to the service provider. A very 
small proportion of the children (0.6%) stated that they would take no action if their friend face online child sexual 
abuse. Interestingly, the prevalence of reporting the case on a governmental (8.1%) or non-governmental online 
portal (1.7%) remained quite low across all sampled districts.
96.8% of the children would report a case of online sexual abuse, as opposed to 55% of the mothers.
Sitamarhi (Bihar) (81%) and 24 Parganas North (West Bengal) (79%) had the highest proportions of mothers 
who would report cases of online child sexual abuse. In contrast, Prayagraj (UP) (23.9%) and Barmer (Rajasthan) 
(26.9%) had the lowest proportions of mothers reporting this.

As compared to mothers, a higher proportion of children (96.8%) mentioned that they would report a case of 
online child sexual abuse if they came across one. All children from Balrampur, Bareilly, Barmer, Jaipur, Darjeeling, 
and Darbhanga, mentioned that they would report the case. However, in Katihar and Prayagraj, almost 25% of 
the children mentioned they wouldn’t report such incidents. The findings suggest a need for shift in attitudes of 
mothers regarding reporting of online abuse cases. 
Police station/cyber cell was reported as the most common choice for both mothers and children to report or seek 
help from in case they witness a case of online child sexual abuse.
99.3% of the mothers (N = 3643) reported that they will report a case of online abuse or exploitation of children 
to the police station or cyber cell. Only a small percentage of mothers (6.5%) reported that they will seek help 
from government online crime reporting portals. (Refer to table A.7 .24 in Annexure 7)
A high, yet relatively lower percentage of children across all sampled districts reported that they would report the 
case to the police station or cyber cell (80.8%). More than 50% of the children also reported that they would seek 
help from their parents. ((Refer to table A.7 .22 in Annexure 7))

As shown in table 3.6.3, at least 1 mother from all the districts of West Bengal reported that their child had faced 
online sexual abuse. The highest number of mothers reporting their child facing online abuse were from Bihar- 
Gaya (1.2%, n= 5), followed by Sitamarhi (1%, n= 4) and Darbhanga (1%, n= 4). Of those who reported that their 
child had faced online abuse, the common response by them on what they did do in such a situation was either 
they asked the child to block/delete the number (n= 9) or asked the person to stop contacting the child (n= 12). 
A very low number of mothers reported that they reached out to any governmental (n= 5) or non-governmental 
helplines or portal for help (n= 3).
Therefore, the practices on actions against abuse indicate a need for a shift in attitudes and practices associated 
with actions against abusers. Greater awareness of governmental and non-governmental portals/helplines are 
needed. BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 103

3.7 Other Key Findings
Creating a protective ecosystem for children involves a multifaceted approach that involves systems at micro, 
meso, and macro levels which are interactive and interwoven in nature.
At the individual/micro level, we will explore factors such as children’s agency and parental support. We also 
present insights on mental health illness among children.  Parents play a pivotal role by not only offering emotional 
support and guidance but also fostering an environment where children feel secure enough to communicate and 
share their concerns openly.
At the meso level, we look at a safe school environment that ensures the continuity of education, and we present 
findings on children’s experience of violence in school and the school’s environment and role in child protection.  
At the Macro level, we have explored the current policy and institutional support for children’s protection and 
discuss challenges and opportunities for strengthening the institutional response. 
KEY FINDINGS
• 73.5% of the children across all districts experienced 1 or more mental health illness in the past 12 
months. 
• 83.8% of the children have someone in their life to turn to for support or suggestions to discuss any 
personal problem. 85.1% reported reaching out to mothers as compared to 56.1% reaching out to fathers.
• 24% of children witnessed a teacher engaging in corporal punishments.

Of all the children across 16 sampled districts, 73. 5% of the children reported experiencing at least 1 or more 
mental health illness in the past 12 months.
The highest proportion of children were from Murshidabad (West Bengal) (98.3%) and Balrampur (Rajasthan) 
(93.4%). Whereas the district with the lowest prevalence of child reporting mental health illness were Jaipur 
(53.9%), Sitamarhi (55.1%) and Bharatpur (58.8%).
Barmer and Darbhanga had a relatively higher proportion of children who experienced mental health illness 
frequently.
More than 60% of the children reported that they either felt down, depressed, and hopeless (65.5%) or felt nervous 
and anxious (61.3%) in the past 12 months. The highest proportion of children from Murshidabad (West Bengal) 
felt depressed or hopeless (89%), 58.3% felt it sometimes and 27 .1% felt it rarely. This was followed by Balrampur 
(UP) (87 .3%). Barmer (Rajasthan) had 8.5% of children who felt depressed most of the time (4.1%) or always 
(4.4%) in the last 12 months. A relatively higher proportion of children from Sitamarhi and Darbhanga district of 
Bihar felt depressed or hopeless most of the time (Sitamarhi 6.6%; Darbhanga 6.6%) or always (Sitamarhi 1.7%; 
Darbhanga 1.5%). (Refer to table A.8.1 in Annexure 8)).

A similar trend was observed when children reported their experience of feeling nervous or anxious. While the 
highest proportion of children from Murshidabad (West Bengal) and Balrampur (UP) felt nervous or anxious 
rarely (Murshidabad 41%; Balrampur 39.3%) or sometimes (Murshidabad 43.2%; Balrampur 46.3%), a relatively 
higher proportion of children from Barmer and Darbhanga felt anxious most of the time (Barmer 7 .6%; Darbhanga 
7 .1 %) in the past 12 months. (Refer to table A.8.2 in Annexure 8)
A relatively lesser proportion of children reported that they could not sleep at night because they were tense 
(45.9%). Similar to the above two statements, the highest proportion of children from Murshidabad (West Bengal) 
reported that they were not able to sleep at night sometimes (38.5%) or rarely (28.3%) because they were tense 
about something. A relatively high percentage from the district also reported that they were not able to sleep 
most of the time (9%). Similar to above, a high proportion of children from Barmer and Darbhanga stated not 
being able to sleep at night most of the time (Barmer 6.8%; Darbhanga 7 .1%) or always (Barmer 7 .3%; Darbhanga 
2%) in the past 2 months. (Refer to table A.8.3 in Annexure 8)

3.7 .1.3 Parental Support 
83.8% of the children across all districts reported that they have someone in their life to turn to for support or 
suggestions to discuss any personal problem. 
The highest proportions were reported from Gaya (Bihar) (96.6%), followed by Murshidabad (West Bengal) 
(95.6%) and Katihar (Bihar) (92.7%). Children from Dungarpur (66.8%), and Barmer (73.4%), district of Rajasthan 
had the lowest proportions of children, who reported to have any support from someone close. (Refer to table 
A.8.4 in Annexure 8)
The qualitative findings on mental health indicate widespread acknowledgment among government officials regarding 
the profound impact of mental health issues on vulnerable individuals. The urgent need for intervention is recognized, 
with advocacy for counselling.
Government officials in West Bengal (WB) highlighted that mental trauma and significant trust issues 
made children highly vulnerable. They emphasized the urgent need for intervention in mental health issues, 
acknowledging the trauma experienced by both referred and unaddressed cases. The officials expressed 
strong support for children’s mental health, advocating for essential psychosocial support, such as group 
sessions, counseling, and various therapeutic approaches. One official explicitly stated, “Support to work 
on mental health issues is one of the most required fields of intervention, as most children are traumatized by 
their experience.” Another affirmed, “Yes, we were very supportive of children’s mental health.” In Bihar, school 
authorities stated that depression in children was rare, but government officials highlighted the lasting 
impact of any incident on a child’s mental health. They stressed the importance of prioritizing mental health 
in child protection, recognizing the need for proper arrangements to address mental health damage. A Bihar 
government official emphasized, “If a child is suffering, then just as food is important for him, his mental health is 
also important.” Another added, “We could see how the children had been harmed externally, but we couldn’t even 
reveal the mental damage done to them, and we didn’t have any proper arrangement for this.”

The majority of children (85.1%) reported reaching out to mothers in case they needed any support or suggestions 
regarding any personal problem. Whereas only 56.1% of the children reached out to their fathers for any support. 
Across all the districts, children reported reaching out to mothers more than fathers.  (Refer to Figure 3.7 .4)
While majority of the children reported their parents comforting them and providing advice often, a lower percentage 
felt they could always share personal problems, and a few also experienced frequent parental comparisons, with 
higher rates in specific districts of Bihar like Darbhanga and Sitamarhi.
More than 95% of children stated that their parents comforted them (97 .7%) and gave advice to them about 
something (98.7%). Out of this, more than 70% reported that their parents did so always (>44%) or most of the 
time (>32%). As compared to other districts, in Dungarpur, a relatively lower proportion of children reported that 
their parents comforted them when they were sad (89.5%) or gave advice about something (90.5%).(Refer to 
table A.8.6 in Annexure 8)
As compared to the above two statements, a slightly lower percentage of children reported that they could 
always (36.7%) share any personal problems or issues related to school with their parents. (Refer to table A.8.11 
in Annexure 8)
13.8% of the children reported that their parents always used to compare them with someone else. The highest 
reported percentages were observed from Darbhanga (30.7%), followed by Sitamarhi (29.3%) and Gaya (25.1%). 
(Refer to table A.8.8 in Annexure 8)
Mothers were approached for help more than fathers in case the child experienced any mental health illness. 
Support from mental health experts remained low (explored in greater detail in section 3.7 .3).
To address the sensitive topic of help-seeking for child sexual abuse, storytelling was employed during 
focused group discussions, eliciting children’s perspectives. The narrative unfolds with the character Neepa 
facing abuse from her uncle. When asked about what Nipa should do in this situation, children’s responses 
reflected a spectrum of attitudes towards parental support. Statements included: “Nipa will not be able to 
tell her parents,” as indicated in the Nipa-FGD; “Nipa should tell her parents, and parents should file a police 
complaint”; and the observation that “Children want to tell this to their parents or any elder, but they do not 
take their words seriously and consider the children themselves guilty; that is why children hesitate to tell 
their parents.” Similarly, in the context of seeking help for corporal punishment, one child expressed concern, 
stating, “Children should tell their parents. But we are not able to do this because we are afraid that we might 
get beaten again,” highlighting potential hesitation.BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 109

Figure 3.7 .5 shows that the majority of children reached out to their mothers (81.2%) to share their mental 
health issues. A lesser proportion of children across all districts reported that they reached out to their fathers 
(37 .9%). A significant percentage difference can be witnessed between reaching out to mothers and fathers in 
Darjeeling (Mothers 79.8%; Fathers 4.3%) and Darbhanga (Mothers 83.1%; Fathers (9.7%). (Refer to table A.8.18 
in Annexure 8)
Findings suggest that, in many districts, children were more comfortable in reaching out to their friends than 
their fathers. This was evident in all the districts of Bihar and West Bengal. A small proportion of 1.1% of children 
approached a mental health expert in case they experienced any mental health illness. The highest proportion of 
children were from Sitamarhi (10.6%).
The findings suggest a scope for greater awareness and shift in practices with respect to mental health well-
being. Concentrated efforts are needed to spread awareness about the importance and normality of reaching 
out to a mental health expert.

A small proportion of the children had witnessed teachers punishing or slapping children at school.
Of those children who were enrolled in school, 24% of them witnessed a teacher punishing someone by making 
them stand or kneel for a long time, do sit-ups, stand in the corner, or stand in a “murga” position. The highest 
proportions were reported from Bareilly (57 .7%); Murshidabad (57 .6%); and North Praganas (48.8%). (Refer to 
table A.8.13 in Annexure 8)
16.9% of the children also witnessed teachers slapping or physically hurting a fellow student. The highest 
proportions of children from Murshidabad (41.1%) and Barmer (39.3%) witnessed this in school. A relatively 
higher proportion of children from North Praganas (18.5%) and Murshidabad (16.7%) witnessed teachers using 
humiliating or insulting language in school.110 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM

Differing views on prevalence of corporal punishment surfaced, with some acknowledging personal experiences while others 
claimed ignorance. Students admitted witnessing abuse, particularly for incomplete homework or disruptive behaviour. 
Stakeholders assert the absence of corporal punishment but believe occasional displays of authority is necessary.
Prevalence: The perspectives on the prevalence of corporal punishment among children exhibited significant 
variation. While one participant openly acknowledged personal experiences of witnessing corporal punishment 
in both school and at a coaching center, another group of children presented a contrasting viewpoint. The 
child expressed, “We have never seen or heard of this happening, neither in our school nor anywhere else.”
However, amidst this diversity of perspectives, some students within the same group admitted to witnessing 
such abuse, particularly when a child failed to complete homework or behaved disruptively in the classroom. 
This was articulated through statements like, “ Especially when we forget to do our homework or are untidy in 
school, violating rules of the school. Sometimes even when teachers come into the classroom with anger and grudges, 
they pour their anger onto students.” 
Despite these observations, when prompted for details about specific instances of abuse, the students clarified 
that they had never witnessed incidents involving the cutting of a child’s hair within the school setting. One 
child stated, “I have seen in my school when children do not turn in their homework and when someone indulges in 
bullying. I have not seen children getting their hair cut.”
Knowledge and Awareness: Looking at the photo prompts, the children consistently noticed a pattern – 
teachers giving punishments to students. “The teacher is beating the student,” remarked one child, highlighting 
the harsh reality of corporal punishment . Another child observed, “The teacher is doing hair cutting.” 
Government and non-governmental stakeholders show a collective awareness of corporal punishment. They 
are well-versed in procedures and regulations related to incidents of corporal punishment. In the focus group 
discussions, children offered rich qualitative insights into the factors they believe contribute to incidents of 
corporal punishment. A prevailing theme in their discussions was the perception that these incidents often 
stem from students making mistakes or engaging in disruptive behaviors. As one child put it, “Perhaps they 
might be causing disturbance in the class or not doing any homework, etc.”
A distinctive aspect highlighted by the participants was the association between students’ appearances 
and disciplinary actions. The children mentioned instances where students had their hair cut as a form of 
punishment, with one child stating, “Children’s hair is cut when they have long hair.”  Furthermore, deviations 
from prescribed grooming norms, such as not braiding hair, were identified as specific triggers: “In this picture, 
the girls have not braided their hair, hence the teachers are cutting their hair.” Children also mentioned that “painting 
nails” and “coloring hair” could also lead to disciplinary consequences. 
Academic performance emerged as another notable factor linked to disciplinary measures. The children 
conveyed a belief that not completing homework or forgetting it could lead to punitive actions. This sentiment 
was captured in statements like, “It happens when we do not do some homework or do not remember it, and it is for 
our good” and “When children do not study, teachers scold them.”
The children also acknowledged the emotional state of teachers as a contributing factor. They expressed an 
understanding that teachers might vent their anger onto students. As one child explained, “ Sometimes even 
when teachers come into the classroom with anger and grudges, they pour their anger onto students.”BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 111

3.7.2.2 Safe School
A. School Attendance
Of the total sampled children, 88.7% (n = 5821) were enrolled in school, and 11.3% (n = 739) were not currently 
enrolled in school. 17 .6% (n = 129) of the children who were not enrolled in school, reported that they had never 
attended school ever. The remaining 610 children did not complete their education. 
The most reported reason for not completing school was to work in order to help the family financially.
The highest percentage of children from Katihar (Bihar) reported this (64.8%; n = 46). Shortage of money for 
school materials/transportation and school dress was also reported to be one of the reasons for not completing 
education by 32.5% children. The highest percentage of children who could not afford to continue going to school 
were from Uttar Pradesh (Balrampur 42.2%, n = 65; Chandauli 61.8%, n= 21; Bareilly 42.1%, n= 61; Prayagraj 
34.8%, n= 42.1%).(Refer to table A.8.15 in Annexure 8) 
It is interesting to note that, 15.6% of the children (n= 95) also stated that their parents did not want them to attend 
school. The highest proportion of children from Bareilly district of Uttar Pradesh reported this (26.2%, n = 38).
Some of the other lesser reported reasons for not completing education was school being too far off (9.5%), did 
not find school safe (1.6%), Only children from 4 districts reported that they did not find school safe, of those 3 
were from Bihar (Sitamarhi 15.6%; Gaya 9.5%; Darbhanga 7 .4%).

B. School Facilities
A relatively higher number of children from the districts of Bihar reported a lack of separate and clean toilets for 
boys and girls. 
Separate toilets for boys and girls- The majority of the children reported that they had access to separate toilets for 
boys and girls at school. In districts of Bihar- Darbhanga (91.9%) and Katihar (92.7%), a relatively lower proportion 
of children reported having separate toilets for boys and girls. (Refer to table A.8.17 in Annexure 8)
Clean Toilets- A relatively lesser percentage of children stated that the toilets were clean at school (85.8%). The 
districts with the lowest reported proportions were Sitamarhi (67 .6%), Jalpaiguri (77 .2%), and Katihar (77 .6%). 
(Refer to table A.8.17 in Annexure 8)
Safety in using toilets- More than 90% of the children in all districts reported that they feel safe while using the 
toilet at school. However, two districts of Bihar reported a lower prevalence than the overall average of 85.8%- 
Sitamarhi (69%) and Darbhanga (82.2%). In all districts, more than 90% of the children reported using the toilets 
without anyone seeing, only in Bharatpur (Rajasthan), the proportion was lower (85.3%) (Refer to table A.8.17 in 
Annexure 8)
A majority of children (42%) across all the sampled districts reported that they were never offered lunch at school. 
The highest percentage was reported from Jaipur (61.3%), followed by Bharatpur (59.5%) and Gaya (56.8%). 39% 
of the children also reported that they received lunch on a everyday basis in school, in the last 30 days. Highest 
proportion of children from districts of West Bengal reported receiving lunch on an everyday basis (Murshidabad 
70.8%; North Praganas 61.6%; Darjeeling 59.5%; Jalpaiguri 44.9%). (Refer to table A.8.18 in Annexure 8)

C. Systems for School Protection and School Safety Initiatives
The prevailing sentiment regarding punishment, particularly corporal punishment, was resolute – it should not be 
administered at all.
While some children acknowledged that teachers might resort to scolding or punishment for the welfare of the 
child, a unanimous agreement emerged against the acceptance of excessive punishment. One child succinctly 
articulated this viewpoint, stating, “Children should not be beaten or punished too much because children do not 
commit any mistake intentionally.” Beyond the rejection of excessive punishment, there was a shared belief in the 
effectiveness of a more compassionate and nurturing approach to discipline. One child said, “Children can also be 
explained with love. If the child still does not understand, then it is necessary to talk to their parents.”
Moving to seeking help in the face of corporal punishment, the children demonstrated a proactive stance. One 
child emphasized this proactive mentality, stating, “If this is always happening, then the child should complain about 
it to the teacher or his principal or his family’s guardian.”  The hierarchy for lodging complaints included parents, 
headmasters, and, in certain cases, seeking assistance from higher authorities if necessary.
In instances where a child acknowledged fault, there was an acceptance of apologizing. However, a clear 
demarcation was drawn between taking responsibility for one’s actions and enduring severe corporal punishment. 
SMC Officials highlight optimistic school environments with child protection awareness, yet gaps remain in 
addressing issues such as child sexual abuse and underutilization of complaint boxes.
SMC officials contribute to a generally optimistic portrayal of school environments, particularly noting awareness 
sessions on child protection issues prevalent in most states, excluding UP . These sessions are credited with 
fostering vigilance and self-awareness among students, encouraging them to report cases, and acting as a 
preventive measure against issues like child marriage. Notably, discussions on child sexual abuse or online child 
sexual abuse are reported as lacking in certain regions.
Stakeholders noted that most schools have a complaint box, but officials say it is needed and unused as children 
prefer to complain verbally or through parents. 
3.7 .3 Macro Level
From our FGDs and Interviews, we attempt to comprehensively understand the engagement of various 
stakeholders in the child protection landscape. Organizing this section within the 4 P’s framework – prevention, 
protection, partnerships, and prosecution – is pivotal for a holistic overview.
3.7.3.1 Prevention
Most states prioritized prevention through education, intertwining children with government schemes. The DWCD 
shielded with education, while the ICDS counselled on responsible digital activities. The DCPU adopted a multi-
pronged approach, and another state focused on cultural preventive measures against child marriage.114 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM

In Uttar Pradesh, the Department of Women and Child Development (DWCD) aimed to create a safety net for 
children through education. A representative stated, “The mission was not merely linking children with schools but 
intertwining them with government schemes. Education served as the shield, the prevention strategy.” Additionally, the 
Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) in Uttar Pradesh proactively counselled children and parents on 
responsible mobile and online activities. An official explained, “Counselling was done if any such incident came to 
notice. We advised children and parents about the use of mobiles and online activities.”
In Bihar, the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) took a multi-pronged approach with extensive awareness 
campaigns, meetings, hoardings, and the formation of Child Protection Committees (CPC) at the block and 
panchayat levels. The NGO sector in Bihar collaborated with women’s and children’s groups, forming CPCs in 
multiple panchayats. A representative stated, “We kept making the children aware of the legal rights they had through 
camps. We worked at the social, institutional, and administrative levels to strengthen the Child Protection Committee in 
the entire district.” Rajasthan stood out for its cultural understanding in preventive measures against child marriage, 
with awareness campaigns on Akha Teej using puppet shows and street plays.
Despite initiatives aimed at generating awareness, gaps persist in addressing child protection issues, with 
stakeholders in multiple states citing a pervasive lack of knowledge as a significant challenge.
A government official in West Bengal stated, “No increase in cases; all stakeholders were able to work, but due to a lack 
of awareness or failing to make people more aware of the process, reporting and identifying the abuse remained an area 
to work on.” Another government official from West Bengal highlighted the interconnected challenges of poor 
awareness, substance abuse, poverty, and societal norms, stating, “Log kya sochey ga” (“What will people think”). 
In Bihar, an NGO representative attributed the surge in child labor cases to poverty and a lack of awareness, 
stating, “In the district, poverty and lack of awareness were the major reasons for increasing child labor.” Another NGO 
in Bihar emphasized the lack of awareness among girls as the primary reason for the growing number of child 
sexual abuse cases. Furthermore, a government official from Bihar characterized the district as an outsourcing 
point for child labor due to the guardians’ lack of awareness and education.
In Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh also government officials drew attention to the vulnerability of children in rural 
areas due to a lack of awareness, knowledge, and poverty. In Uttar Pradesh, one official mentioned, “In the absence 
of proper knowledge and information, children took wrong decisions due to which girls or boys had to face several problems.”
3.7.3.2 Protection
Protection measures were robust across states
In Uttar Pradesh, collaborative efforts between the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) and the police, 
particularly in cases involving children with disabilities, facilitated legal aid. Child Welfare Committees (CWC) played 
a vital role in rescue and rehabilitation. West Bengal’s Department of Women and Child Development and Social 
Welfare (DWCD&SW) implemented child welfare schemes, with active NGO participation in rescue operations. 
In Dungarpur, Rajasthan, a comprehensive approach involving government entities, NGOs, and CWCs protected 
children through shelter and specialized care. Bihar’s Missing Track Portal streamlined information on missing and 
rescued children, enhancing protective interventions. Across states, swift activation of protection systems upon 
receiving child-related news was highlighted, with prompt intervention from local administration and law enforcementBASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 115

Diverse child mental health services are implemented across states, ranging from the provision of one-on-one 
counselling to post-rescue support and art therapy.
Mental health services offered to children varied. In West Bengal, officials mentioned providing one-on-one child 
counselling, while in Bihar, the focus was on post-rescue counselling to help children overcome mental trauma 
and prevent relapses into harmful environments. Art therapy was employed, and awareness programs were 
organized to educate communities about mental health. A Bihar official explained, “When children were rescued 
from the brothels, they had this mindset of going back to the same place or profession because of the fear that their 
parents wouldn’t accept them or no one was going to marry them, so we offered counselling.” 
Reporting hurdles compound child protection issues: some face hesitancies, others advocate urgency, and there are 
struggles with online abuse awareness gaps
In West Bengal, parents’ hesitancy to file General Diary (GD) entries led to delays and withdrawals, exacerbating 
the under-reporting of child trafficking cases. A West Bengal official emphasized, “Child trafficking exists in the 
district but is under-reported.” 
The gravity of reporting was underscored in Bihar during a focus group discussion where participants expressed 
the importance of reporting child trafficking and labor cases. They asserted, “ Yes, it is important. It should be 
reported. If not reported, the child will spoil his/her future life.”  However, the challenge persisted as a government 
official in Bihar shed light on the limitation in their information network, stating, “We only get those cases that are 
reported. We do not get information about those cases which are not reported.”
The issue extended to online child abuse cases, as acknowledged by government officials in both Bihar and Uttar 
Pradesh. A government official in Bihar noted, “We have not had any cases of online child abuse so far,” emphasizing 
the lack of reported cases. Similarly, a government official in Uttar Pradesh stated, “Online child sexual abuse cases 
are also very rare in our district. Cases are not reported.” Despite efforts such as organizing workshops on cybercrime, 
government officials in Uttar Pradesh expressed frustration at the scarcity of reported cases, indicating a 
significant gap in awareness and reporting. 
The absence of ID proof, coupled with weak monitoring, creates hurdles in accessing child protection services.
Uttar Pradesh officials shed light on the uphill battle in proving offenders’ minor status due to protracted legal 
processes. Families, often uninformed about available legal support, may not pursue cases diligently. A poignant 
statement from a Uttar Pradesh government official reveal, “To prove that the offender is a minor (under 18 years 
old) is one of the key challenges. Sometimes children appear older due to the time-taking process of legal provisions.”
The process of documenting cases of child labor and ensuring the effectiveness of government welfare schemes 
in Uttar Pradesh encountered substantial hurdles linked to identification proof. An official emphasized, “During 
the field visits, I realized that government welfare schemes were not reaching the desired beneficiaries due to several 
reasons. One of the reasons was that eligible beneficiaries either didn’t possess required/necessary documentary proof or

Moreover, the absence of strong monitoring and awareness compounded the situation. Street children, who frequently 
migrated without any identity proof, added another layer to the challenge. The official further explained, “Street children 
were also found in the district. They usually migrated from one place to another without holding any identity proof.”
Rehabilitating rescued children poses complex challenges including certificate issues, follow-up gaps, and lack of 
comprehensive plans.
This challenge was exemplified by an experience shared by the NGO personnel when he was actively addressing 
child labor issues. He recounted, “I would like to share one of our experiences a few years back when we were working 
on child labor issues. Some children were rescued in another state by our team effort. For the rehabilitation of the children, 
the issuance of certificates from that area/district was required by the district administration/concerning department.”  
The complexity intensified in areas that posed challenges or sensitivity regarding children’s deployment in labor 
work. This sentiment was echoed by an NGO in West Bengal, emphasizing the absence of a comprehensive 
rehabilitation plan. In Bihar, another government official raised concerns about the lack of proper follow-up on 
child labor cases, creating the potential for rescued children to return to labor work. 
Infrastructure deficiencies impede child protection measures: absence of shelter homes, inadequate office space, 
and transportation constraints.
In Uttar Pradesh, the effective implementation of child protection measures faced significant impediments due 
to the shortage of space, transportation, and infrastructure. A government official in Uttar Pradesh lamented, 
“There was a lack of vehicles, transportation, and infrastructure.”
This deficiency was further highlighted by a government official’s statement regarding the major gap in the child 
protection ecosystem in the district. They emphasized the absence of shelter homes for girls and boys, stressing 
the need for safe environments. 
An NGO representative in Uttar Pradesh added to the concerns, citing the inadequacy of office space. They stated, 
“There was no proper space in the office. We could just make a letter and could do work somehow, but we did not have sufficient 
space for keeping the records and doing work in a proper way. The senior officer(s) engaged DCPU staff in other works.”
Insufficient resources hinder support for rescued children in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Government officials in 
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar voiced frustrations over insufficient resources, impeding their ability to address the 
basic needs of rescued children. 
Funding constraints significantly impacted the functioning of past organizations dedicated to child welfare. Another 
representative expressed the challenge, stating, “Yes, the lack of funding for organizations like us. We were not able 
to work as per the need. We organized events by paying from our pockets most of the time.” The collective frustration 
underscores the urgent requirement for increased past financial support to enable more comprehensive past 
child welfare initiatives.
NGO staff unveil knowledge and training gaps particularly at the Gram Panchayat level
NGOs in Rajasthan and Bihar have consistently stressed the imperative need for improved training to effectively 
combat online child exploitation and enhance the knowledge of stakeholders, particularly at the Gram Panchayat level.BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 117

In Bihar, NGO personnel discussed the urgency of enhancing the knowledge of Gram Panchayat-level stakeholders. 
A representative from Bihar NGOs reflected, “There was still a lot of need for improvement, and the professional 
hijackers were very big experts. If you became an expert here by doing very small courses, then there was a need 
for a lot of improvement in this.” This reiterated the need for comprehensive training and expertise to effectively 
address online child exploitation.
Officials grapple overwhelming responsibilities. They advocate for specialized approaches.
Officials in Bihar openly shared the challenges posed by overwhelming responsibilities, advocating for specialized 
roles to ensure more effective child welfare. A heartfelt plea from a government official in Bihar reflected, “ The 
most important challenges for us are that if any person is associated with any case or the responsibility he has, then he is 
not responsible for just one thing.” 
Highlighting operational challenges, a government official in Rajasthan shed light on the struggles faced during work 
hours. “You could clearly notice the flaws. There were five of us. We were here from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. There was nowhere we 
could go to eat. There was nowhere for relaxing down. We had meetings regularly. We had to accomplish this and that.” 
Poor constitution and limited functionality of Child Protection Committees (CPCs) across states - Data reveals stark 
operational rates .
Our team gathered data on the functioning of Child Protection Committees (CPCs) across four states. In Bihar, out 
of 40 villages, CPCs were formed and functioned in only 4 villages. These villages were Rasulganj urf Koili, Khairwan 
Malahi, Ghurghura Hanumannagar urf Ghurghura Baluaha, and Sarkhandio Bitha. The partner organizations 
collected this data by consulting with the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU), other relevant departments, and 
officers. They also spoke with social workers from their organizations who operated in these villages.
In Uttar Pradesh, out of 40 villages, 30 villages had CPCs, presenting a more positive picture. However, out of the 
30-plus CPCs formed, only 3 were functioning. The partner organizations obtained this data by engaging with 
the DCPU, relevant departments, and officers in Uttar Pradesh.
In West Bengal, CPCs were established in all 40 villages, but unfortunately, not even one was functioning. Our 
partner organizations collected this information by consulting with the DCPU, Block Development Officers, and 
social workers operating in the villages in West Bengal.
Unfortunately, we could not access the CPC data for Rajasthan through our partners.  This was due to a change 
of government after the recent election and the subsequent change of officials in relevant departments.
Mental health support challenges - stakeholders advocate ‘mind-washing’, highlight resource shortage.
Challenges existed, as highlighted by Bihar officials, who stressed the importance of regular “mind-washing,” 
counselling, and training by mental health specialists to address the “fear” and “mindset” of rescued children.  “  A 
UP official highlighted the lack of resources to offer mental health services.
Despite acknowledging the urgency and significance of mental health interventions (as discussed earlier in section 
3.7 .1.2) the stakeholders did not provide detailed insights into specific strategies or structured frameworks 
in place. This lack of granularity raises questions about the comprehensiveness of their understanding and 
implementation of effective mental health support. 118 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM

3.7 .3.3 Partnerships
Stakeholders emphasized past successful child protection initiatives, highlighting key elements such as streamlined 
communication, a collective approach, and structured collaboration. Nationwide, effective coordination 
among various departments, regular district-level meetings, and the potential consequences of negligence were 
underscored, emphasizing the critical importance of coordinated effort.
Stakeholders have consistently emphasized the significance of partnerships, highlighting coordinated efforts 
among government departments, NGOs, and the judiciary. A government official from Uttar Pradesh emphasized 
the success achieved through interdepartmental coordination, noting, “Our child protection success came from 
streamlined communication and regular meetings among administrative departments.”
Insights from a government official in Bihar revealed a structured approach, stating, “In Bihar, the Juvenile 
Justice Board, Child Welfare Committee, and District Child Protection Unit worked collaboratively, ensuring a 
comprehensive effort for all children.”
Similarly, in Rajasthan, a government official highlighted practical coordination, stating, “There was good 
coordination between everyone. We contributed our part, providing assistance when needed in our collaborative 
child protection efforts.”
Furthermore, stakeholders emphasized the regular and periodic meetings held at the district level among related 
departments and officials. The awareness of the necessity of convergence was evident, with a government official 
from West Bengal stating, “We can destroy children’s life if we don’t coordinate well, we can’t compromise our 
work for leisure.”
Negligence or lack of convergence was acknowledged to have serious consequences, as highlighted by an NGO 
representative from West Bengal: “Negligence of their activity or lack of convergence would not bring justice; the 
process would make it worse for them and might as well lead to harassment.”
Exclusion and coordination challenges affect community stakeholders. 
The coordination challenges within child welfare initiatives present a complex scenario, with most stakeholders 
noting the absence of significant coordination gaps. However, specific challenges have been identified by certain 
stakeholders. A community representative from Bihar expressed a lack of collaboration with other stakeholders 
in the state, stating, “We work independently mostly. Yes, we do not have coordination with any agency or 
department. We work for *****management. We are isolated within the system.”
3.7 .3.4 Prosecution
Legal aid and support are crucial in addressing child online abuse, with a systematic approach in play. Collaboration 
between SLSA and NGOs ensures thorough investigations and victim protection. Efforts to fortify legal infrastructure 
face accessibility challenges, particularly in delivering justice to all corners.
In the pursuit of justice and safeguarding the rights of children, legal aid and support became indispensable 
components. In the context of Bihar, the State Legal Services Authority (SLSA) played a pivotal role in providing BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 119

legal assistance. NGOs in the state collaborated with legal authorities to ensure that children, especially victims 
of online abuse, received due attention.
 When addressing online abuse cases against children, NGOs emphasized a systematic approach. Initially, 
complaints were lodged at the police station, triggering a supervised investigation. The administration 
subsequently took charge, conducting inquiries while maintaining the utmost secrecy to protect the identities of 
victims. This multi-layered process ensured a comprehensive and discreet handling of online abuse cases. 
Systemic issues and oversight challenges result in delayed justice for child abuse cases 
In Rajasthan, a representative from an NGO shed light on the challenges faced by children in receiving timely 
justice. The representative emphasized that the investigative process played a crucial role in the delay of justice 
for child abuse cases. They stated, “See, it remained that whatever cases of children were investigated, due to the gap 
in investigation, children faced difficulties in getting justice or there was a delay in getting justice. All these problems 
arose due to the investigation; the deeper the investigation, the easier it would be, but sometimes due to the delay in 
investigation, there was a delay in getting justice.”
A government representative highlighted a critical gap in the implementation of justice at the ground level. They 
explained, “But it was not implemented at the ground level. People’s awareness about the enacted law is important.” 
Despite having laws in place, there existed a disparity in ensuring their effective application to aid children in a 
timely manner.
Despite grappling with significant challenges and complexities, officials and community representatives 
demonstrate remarkable resilience. They effectively navigate the situation by strategically prioritizing victim 
support and community empowerment amidst diverse pressures.
Bihar officials highlighted significant challenges stemming from political pressure and threats, impacting victim 
testimonies and investigative processes. A candid admission from a Bihar IDI, CWC representative revealed, “The victims 
are pressured into saying that they are not involved in any wrongdoings, and they identify the perpetrators as their families.”
The official continued, expressing concerns for investigators and witnesses, “When we go to those places, we also 
get scared of seeing their homes, and after coming to our workplace, there is also pressure to leave the perpetrators.” The 
clandestine nature of such cases, including hiding children underground, further complicates investigations and 
exposes investigators to potential risks.
Another perspective from a government official in Bihar emphasized the challenges faced by social workers, 
stating, “Since the sevika is a social worker, she is also social. Yes, she belongs to the same community, so if you suddenly 
become against anything, then the entire society will go against you.”  The delicate balance between spreading 
awareness and potential backlash within the community poses additional challenges for those engaged in child 
welfare efforts.4

Recommendation 1- Target attitudes and behavior of parents towards willingness to 
report child protection issues: 
The overall response rate of parents throughout the study indicates lack of willingness to 
report child protection issues. Future interventions should target community members 
(particularly parents) with a focus to improve their willingness to report such incidents. 
Parents play a critical role in enabling or disabling the prevalence of child protection issues. In 
many cases they are involved in the act and in other cases they are not willing to report due to 
stigma, reputation, or fear of further harm. For instance, parents themselves include children 
in work from early age and do not see how it effects their education (an overall development). 
These attitudes are a key roadblock in bringing these issues to light and they must be targeted 
before actual behavior and practices can be improved.   
Evidence/Rationale for the recommendation: Survey found very low proportion of 
mothers willing to report incidents of child marriages in their community with only 13% 
agreeing to report in future incidents. Similarly, 35% of the mothers indicated unwillingness 
to incidents of child sexual abuse. During the data collection several enumerators reported 
identifying children who are currently married but their mothers were not willing to 
acknowledge the same. While for child labor, 18% children reported working during the 
time of survey. Majority of the children reported working in own household related work/
business. 122 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM

RGB 215, 157, 41
HEX D99D29
Recommendation 2- Improve awareness and attitudes on key child marriage issues: 
The study shows several gaps in knowledge around child marriage issues among mothers. 
It is recommended to target communities towards improving their knowledge in child 
marriage indicators like legal age of marriage (especially of boys), negative effects of child 
marriage, etc. Evidence shows misinformation and misplaced beliefs around benefits of 
early marriage which enables parents to get their children (especially daughters) marry early. 
Future intervention should target spreading correct and wholistic knowledge around child 
marriage. It should also ensure discarding misinformation around benefits of child marriages.   
Recommendation 3- Advocacy for creating social protection for children from 
vulnerable groups who lose their primary caretaker:
Evidence from the studies shows that children (specially for vulnerable groups) are 
compelled to work due to the death of primary earner. Future intervention should aim for 
advocating for social schemes from government which provides protection to children in 
such an adverse event. Allowing for their education to continue and not burdening them with 
the responsibility to earn for family.  
Evidence/Rationale for the recommendation: 10% of the children and 7% of the mothers 
reported less than 21 years as the legal age for marriage for boys. Mothers reported that 
the believe early marriage provides protection to girls with only 45% disagreeing with the 
statement “that marriage provides physical and financial safety to girls”. Additionally, 6.5% 
mothers reported that community prefers girls should get married early.  
Evidence/Rationale for the recommendation: 56% of mothers reported that death of 
family members as they key reason for why a child is compelled to work. BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 123

RGB 215, 157, 41
HEX D99D29
Recommendation 4- Increase awareness of children about effects of child labor on 
social development: 
Evidence indicates that children don’t fully comprehend that working early affects their 
overall development and hinders future career prospects. Future intervention should aim 
to increase knowledge around how working early negatively affects studies, playtime, time 
with family/friends etc. And why these are important for that age. 
Recommendation 5- Improve correct knowledge of what constitutes Child Trafficking:
The study indicates community stakeholders are not able to clearly distinguish the difference 
between child trafficking and child labor. Data shows a smaller proportion of children and 
mothers have received information on child trafficking. This is one of the key reasons why 
stakeholders are not able to identify and report an incident of trafficking. We anticipate this also 
would have influenced the responses on witnessing child trafficking during the survey since they 
were not fully aware of what can be categorized as trafficking. Future intervention should focus 
on imparting the correct knowledge of child trafficking and how to identify such cases.   
Evidence/Rationale for the recommendation: 63% of children reported that they don’t think 
work affects any areas of their life. While 44.5% reported that their timely with family and 
friends is reduced due to work and only 9% felt that work does reduces their time for studies 
Evidence/Rationale for the recommendation: Interviews with key informants, particularly 
government stakeholders, reveal that trafficking is often confused as child labor, making the 
issue hard to recognize. stakeholders explained that child trafficking is primarily confused 
with child labor, leaving victims often unaware of their trafficking status. Government 
stakeholders shed light on the dire situation faced by children. One emphasized, “Children 
themselves are not aware that they are trafficked, and they do not know facts like where 
they are going, for what reason they are going, and so on. Sometimes the children are told 
that they are going to work, earning money. Only 40.7% of the children reported that they 
had received information on child trafficking.124 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM

Recommendation 6- Improve knowledge of child sexual abuse: 
Evidence from this study shows a large proportion of mothers and children have not heard of 
sexual abuse. Mothers also lack complete understanding of what can constitute sexual abuse. 
The majority were able identify it with physical actions like forcefully kissing or touching. But 
only a small proportion were able to mention showing private parts, or pulling their clothes 
to expose them etc. Knowledge of important provisions like POCSO is significantly low, 
reflecting poor knowledge and understanding of sexual abuse. Future interventions should 
target improving the knowledge of community members about what all constitutes sexual 
abuse, what are the provisions and laws for the same. 
Recommendation 7- Improve parent’s agency and ownership to supervise children’s 
access and usage of internet.
The evidence from this study shows a large proportion of children accessing the internet 
but relatively smaller percentage reported that their parents supervise their online activity. 
Accessing social media was the most reported activity by children. This makes children more 
vulnerable to online abuse and threats. It is important that guardians actively monitor children’s 
online activities. Future intervention should target parents to improve their knowledge on 
online supervision and enable them to safeguard children’s access to online activities. 
Evidence/Rationale for the recommendation:  46% of the mothers reported not being 
aware of the possibility of children can be subjected to sexual abuse/ harassment. While 
only 35.6% of children reported that they have heard of sexual abuse. Only 6.5% of mothers 
across all districts reported knowing about the POSCO Act (Protection of Children from 
Sexual Offence). 
Evidence/Rationale for the recommendation: 43.6% of mothers reported not supervising 
and monitoring their child’s online activities. In qualitative interactions too. All stakeholders 
perceived parental irresponsibility and lack of supervision as the primary drivers for online 
abuse and vulnerability of children. The misuse of social media, pornography addiction, easy 
access of mobile phones & internet, are also stated as causes. Around 33% of mothers and 
children don’t perceive any threats to privacy and security from the internet.BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 125

Recommendation 8- Improve knowledge of parents on legal provisions and focus on 
increasing access to documents for marginalized community: 
Evidence from qualitative interactions shows that families are often poorly informed about 
available legal support, may not pursue cases diligently. Further they are also not aware of 
many welfares schemes they might be eligible for. Many don’t have the required documents 
to avail benefits under schemes. Future interventions should focus on improving knowledge 
and access to legal provisions and welfare schemes by the community members. This also 
requires focusing on helping people get necessary documents. 
Recommendation 9- Focus on operationalizing child protection committees at the 
village level: 
Evidence from 160 villages covered in this study shows most of the child protection 
committees (CPCs) in these villages are not operational. In several villages the committee 
is yet to be formed.  CPCs play a critical role in reducing child protection issues at the 
village level. Since they are comprised of community members who are affluent, they are 
most aware of what prevails in the village and have a strong buy-in by the village residents. 
Intervention should focus on making these CPCs operational and ensuring these committees 
meat periodically. Further, the CPCs should be leveraged for village level activities to ensure 
a more sustainable effort to curb child protection issues. 
Evidence/Rationale for the recommendation: Based on information gathered from 
qualitative interactions with various government officials, NGOs and community members. 
Evidence/Rationale for the recommendation: In West bengal CPCs were established in 
all the 40 villages covered in the study but it was not operational in any village. In the case of 
Bihar only 4 CPCs were formed and functioning (out of 40) while in Uttar Pradesh this 30 
CPCs were formed but only 3 were functioning. No data was available for Rajasthan. 5

The baseline study of the KAWACH program aimed to draw findings to highlight the current child protection 
scenario in the selected 16 districts. 6560 mothers and children, along with various community-level, NGOs, and 
government stakeholders participated in the study to provide meaningful insights on the prevalence, knowledge, 
attitudes, and practices of 5 key child protection issues outlined below. This section provides an overall conclusion 
of the baseline study.
Child Marriage: The low N-SUM prevalence of child marriage shed light on the underreporting and already existing 
awareness among mothers. It was found that efforts from governmental and non-governmental organizations 
may have made the community aware of the leading legal implications associated with it, which could have led 
to more filtered responses. Beliefs like the elopement of children and societal pressures were highlighted as key 
reasons for early marriage in the communities, showcasing a scope for a shift in beliefs. 
Additionally, there were also gaps in beliefs associated with marriage and its association with the financial and physical 
protection it provides to a girl. Attitudes towards reporting further highlighted a concerning normalization of child 
marriage among mothers, in contrast to the more proactive stance of children. Practices around child marriage 
showcased an extremely small part of the sampled children being currently married. However, the persistence of 
dowry practices across all districts calls for continued efforts to address deep-rooted societal norms.
Child Labor : The prevalence of child labor was low, with significant regional variations, particularly high 
prevalence in West Bengal and Bihar. Underreporting was evident, attributed to the concealment of child labor 
in family assistance roles. Poverty and death of parents or guardians emerged as the primary factors contributing 
to child labor.  
Findings on attitudes reflected a concerning acceptance of children working for relatives showcasing the existence 
of child labor in disguise settings. Still, there was a simultaneous recognition of the importance of education, 
especially among boys during the FGDs. Reporting tendencies were relatively high as opposed to child marriage, 
highlighting mothers’ and children’s willingness to report to authorities, particularly the police. However, seeking 
support from child protection committees or NGOs remained low, signalling potential gaps in awareness or trust.
Practices revealed that more children self-reported to be currently working, as opposed to mothers acknowledging 
this, which indicated underreporting. Fears of trafficking, dropping out of school, and hindrances in pursuing 
future goals highlight the urgency of addressing this issue.
Child Trafficking: The prevalence of child trafficking was significantly low, highlighting the underreporting of 
issues by mothers. The underreporting was primarily due to confusion between child trafficking and child labor, 
showcasing a gap in awareness amongst the community regarding what exactly constitutes as child trafficking. 
There was a gap in awareness and attitudes towards reporting or seeking help from important members of the 
child protection ecosystem-CPCs, and NGO personnel. Migration amongst children for employment activities 
was reported, where mostly family members and friends facilitated their move, highlighting the need for change 
in practices. 
Awareness efforts, particularly in regions with lower knowledge levels, and targeted interventions addressing 
migration for employment can enhance prevention and support mechanisms.128 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM

RGB 215, 157, 41
HEX D99D29
Child Sexual Abuse: The prevalence of CSA remained low, and reasons for underreporting were social norms 
and transmission bias, with children not disclosing abuse experiences to their mothers. This outlined a gap in the 
attitudes and beliefs of the community members concerning the social stigma and norms related to sexual abuse. 
Findings on knowledge draw attention to the awareness gaps within the community, especially children.  The 
data on mothers’ knowledge and the limited conversations they did with children around CSA, highlights the gap 
in mothers’ awareness levels and the need for greater parental involvement. Children’s responses on attitudes 
highlighted their stigmatized beliefs on only girls getting sexually abused and generally strangers are abusers of 
sexual abuse. 
In conclusion, addressing CSA requires awareness strategies to combat the challenge of deep-rooted social norms 
and stigma. Additionally, parents need to realize their role in initiating conversations around sensitive issues such 
as CSA.
Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation: Of all the issues, the lowest prevalence was reported for online sexual 
abuse. The findings highlighted the lack of mothers’ awareness of what their children do on the internet, qualitative 
findings also highlighted the prime reasons for OCSEA as lack of parental supervision. Correct identification of online 
sexual abuse among mothers was also low. And fewer mothers reported discussing the issue with their children. 
In conclusion, Knowledge gaps exist, and attitudes toward reporting need improvement. Strategies should focus 
on raising awareness, enhancing parental supervision, and educating both parents and children on online safety.
Other Key Findings: A protective ecosystem for children requires an interconnected approach, addressing 
issues at micro, meso, and macro levels. The findings reveal various challenges and opportunities within each 
level of the ecosystem.
At the micro or individual level, children’s agency was limited. Mental health concerns among children were also 
prevalent, emphasizing need for seeking help from mental health experts. While a majority had someone to turn 
to for support, there were variations in their perspectives on seeking help for issues like child sexual abuse and 
corporal punishment.
Moving to the meso level, instances of corporal punishment in schools were reported, highlighting the need for a 
shift towards more compassionate disciplinary approaches. 
At the macro level, challenges in child protection initiatives were identified, including underreporting, lack of 
awareness, and problems in age verification and rehabilitation processes.  Infrastructure challenges and funding 
issues persist. Coordination among stakeholders was reported as crucial, and delays in legal processes and 
political pressures were reported as gaps in bringing justice to child abuse cases.
Overall, a holistic and collaborative approach that involves the active participation of individuals, communities, 
educational institutions, and policymakers, along with strategies focusing on increasing awareness around 
different child protection issues is essential. Additionally, a need for change in beliefs around social norms and 
stigma, and the practices associated with it is necessary to create a protective ecosystem for children and ensure 
their well-being and development.

This section includes fact sheets (Data on key indicators) for all 16 districts of the 4 states wherein data collection 
was conducted – Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and West Bengal. The fact sheet for every state will include 3 
components- (i) District-wise N-SUM prevalence (ii) District-wise key indicators reported by mothers, and (iii) 
District-wise key indicators reported by children.
From every district, we interviewed 410 mothers and 410 children which becomes the maximum sample size. 
However, it is evident in the fact sheet that different indicators have varying sample sizes – the underlying reason 
for the same is the skip logic applied for different questions as per requirements (Please refer to Annexure 10 to 
see the data collection tools for children and mothers). 
In the fact sheet sample size indicates the maximum number of respondents who have answered the question. 
In the various cells of the N-SUM prevalence fact sheet across all states, the responses entered are ‘na’. Cells with 
‘na’ indicate that none of the mothers from the district responded to that indicator or the sample size was not 
enough to calculate the prevalence.
The fact sheet is color-coded to indicate the highest and the lowest percentage/estimate across all districts in a 
state for every indicator. The key for each color is the following:

Annexure 9 – Composite score 
 
Steps for composite scores: 
1. Each of the indicators (each attitudinal and beliefs statement) was converted into a binary 
variable, where 0 is the lowest score, and 1 is the highest score.  
2. An average was taken out for all the indicators, across all the respondents, such that each 
respondent gets a score between 0 to 1 (These scores can be a 5-point scale, a 10-point 
scale, or any other point scale, depending on the number of indicators which was used to 
formulate the composite score) 
3. One key aspect here is that all the indicators are given equal weightage. 
 
Colour scale for composite scores: 
      
=>90% > 50% & <90% <= 50%

Annexure 11 – Example of N-SUM calculation 
 
Steps for calculation of N -SUM prevalence rate and estimate for Balrampur (Uttar Pradesh) (Boys who 
are victims of child marriage): 
1.  The population of boys for Balrampur (Uttar Pradesh) under the age of 18 years was extracted from 
census 20113. The population was 490047.  
 
2. Given that the population estimate was gathered from the year 2011, It was assumed that the 
population would have inflated by a certain percentage in the year 2023. Basis this assumption, the 
initial step in computing NSUM estimates for child marriage among boys under 18 in Balrampur 
involved inflating the population by increasing the count of boys below the age of 18. This was 
achieved by multiplying the existing population of boys in Balrampur by 0.124. 
 
𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑏𝑜𝑦𝑠 = 490047 ∗ 0.12 
𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑏𝑜𝑦𝑠(𝑇) = 548852 
 
3. The next step involves calculating the personal network size  of each mother in the district. The 
personal network size of mothers in Balrampur district in Uttar Pradesh is calculated using the 
number of boys they know in the district and the village (Denoted by C)  (Please refer to the known 
population questions asked to the mothers in section 8 of the mother tool in Annexure 10).  
 
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑏𝑜𝑦𝑠 𝑚𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤 𝑖𝑛 𝑣𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑔𝑒 = 6.07 
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑏𝑜𝑦𝑠 𝑚𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤 𝑖𝑛 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑡 = 2.46 
𝐶 = 6.07 + 2.46 
𝐶 = 8.53

4 https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=IN 208 | P a g e 
 
4. The next step is to calculate the average child marriage cases known by mothers 5 in Balrampur 
(Denoted by m). 
  
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑏𝑜𝑦𝑠 𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑏𝑦  𝑚𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑠(𝑚)  = 1.18738629 
 
5. The last step is to calculate N-SUM estimates for Balrampur using the following formula: 
 
𝐶𝑀 = 𝑚
𝐶 ∗ 𝑇 
 
𝐶𝑀 = 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝐵𝑎𝑙𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑢𝑟 
𝑚 = 𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑏𝑜𝑦𝑠 𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑏𝑦 𝑚𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑠 
𝐶 = 𝑁𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘 𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 
𝑇 = 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑏𝑜𝑦𝑠 𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 
 
𝐶𝑀 = 1.18738629
8.53  ∗ 548852 
 
𝐶𝑀(𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒) = 76401 
  
𝐶𝑀(𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒) = 13.9%

Annexure 13 – List of ethical considerations for the baseline study 
 
T able A.13.1: List of Ethical Considerations 
Informed Consent 
 
It was essential to ensure that participants were fully informed 
about the purpose, procedures, potential risks, and benefits of the 
research or project, and obtain their voluntary consent to 
participate. The consent outlined the following 5 key points: 
 
• Voluntary Participation: It was ensured that individuals were not 
coerced or unduly influenced to participate in the study. They had 
the freedom to make independent decisions based on their 
judgment and without any external pressures. 
 
• Confidentiality: Participants were assured that their personal 
information would be protected and kept confidential. They were 
informed that their identity would be anonymized or 
pseudonymized, and their privacy would be respected throughout 
the study. 
 
• Risks: When explaining risks in the informed consent process, 
clear and comprehensive information was provided to participants. 
The enumerator discussed steps that would be taken to minimize or 
mitigate the identified risks and explained the safety measures, 
monitoring procedures, or safeguards in place to protect 
participants from harm. 
 
• Benefits: It was important to present benefits in a balanced and 
unbiased manner, using clear language and avoiding any undue 
influence or exaggeration. Participants were provided with a 
realistic understanding of the potential positive outcomes and were 
able to weigh them against the potential risks involved. 
 
• Withdrawal: The enumerator clearly stated that participants had 
the right to withdraw their consent and discontinue their 
involvement in the study or procedure at any time without 
providing a reason. Emphasis was placed on the fact that there 
would be no negative co nsequences or penalties for withdrawing, 
and their decision would be fully respected and supported. 
Do Not Harm 
 
The principle of non-maleficence is sacrosanct to avoid harm to the 
human subjects of the research, both through acts of commission 
and omission.  
 
Extensive training of the field enumerators with clear instructions 
for engagement and exit strategies in case of even perceived harm 
during data collection was ensured. 
 212 | P a g e 
 
Respect and Justice 
The principle of respect implied valuing humans, including children 
and their lived realities. It required recognition that their decisions 
existed within a broader personal, relational, social, cultural, legal, 
and environmental context. The study team re ceived 
comprehensive training on professional research ethics to 
guarantee the following: 
 
• Open-mindedness: They approached the issue with an open 
mind, avoiding assumptions or judgments and acknowledging that 
their perception might differ from that of the stakeholders. 
 
• Respectful Inquiry : They asked the appropriate questions in a 
respectful manner, ensuring that the respondents' perspectives 
were valued and considered. 
 
• Mitigation of Bias : The team actively avoided personal biases, 
including cultural biases, that could influence the data collection 
process, maintaining objectivity and impartiality. 
 
• Handling Emotional Reactions : They were equipped with 
strategies to navigate interviews or surveys in situations where 
respondents exhibited varied emotional reactions, ensuring 
sensitivity and appropriate handling of such instances. 
Privacy & 
Confidentiality  
All participants were assured of the confidentiality of any 
information they share, and care was taken to protect the 
participants’ anonymity through the use of anonymized 
interviewee codes for each respondent, ensuring that the 
recordings were uploaded onto the Cloud and not shared over 
email, and ensuring that only the evaluation and field team had 
access to the recordings and transcripts 213 | P a g e

Phase II: 
Data 
Collection 
Formulation, translation, and digitization of tools:  
Quantitative and qualitative baseline evaluation tools were 
created for each stakeholder, in consultation with the BAT 
team. The final tools were then translated into local languages 
Hindi & Bengali, ensuring accessibility and comprehension for 
diverse populations, and facilitating effective communication 
during the data collection process. 
IRB approval, testing the research tools, 
enumerator/researcher training, and field data collection : 
The project proceeded with obtaining Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) approval, then transitioning to testing the tools to 
identify and address any potential issues. Subsequently, 
comprehensive training was provided to the enumerators and 
qualitative researchers by the core research team of Athena, 
which prepared them for the field data collection phase, which 
involved gathering information from the designat ed study 
areas. 
Data collection and monitoring: The baseline quantitative and 
qualitative data collection was conducted in the month of 
October 2023. In-depth data monitoring was done by the core 
research team of Athena, where daily debrief calls were 
conducted with the field teams to gather field insig hts and 
challenges during the data collection.
